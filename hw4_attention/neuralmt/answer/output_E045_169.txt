when i was in my 20s , i had my first the .
i was a and i was in berkeley . berkeley .
she was a woman named alex .
when the came in the first meeting , she was wearing and a , and she fell in the in office , her and she was me to talk about .
and when i heard that , i was a .
my , had a patient as a patient .
and i got a woman in the people who wanted to talk about .
i 'll get to , i .
but i did n't have it .
with the stories , the alex with the back , was easy to me just to with head with the head of the problems .
" 30 is the new 20 " , " alex and i did , i had the she had right .
work came later , later , later , later came later , later came later .
people in the in the , like alex and i did n't have time .
but i was my , the .
i was .
i said , " yeah , you know , you 're with your with your friends , you get with a , but she 's not going to marry . "
and there said my said , " well , yet , but maybe you 'll going to next the next .
and also , the best time to work on marriage to work before they 're married . "
this is what psychologists call a call .
that was the moment that i realized that 30 is not the new 20 .
yes , people later on as well as a , but did n't mean to the to .
and so , the alex , the , and we sat and them .
and i realized that this kind of the - a problem with real consequences with only consequences , but for their and , but for the , and , all the people in the .
at that point , in the united states , 50 million people in the .
we talk about 15 percent of the population , or 100 percent , if you say that nobody can achieve the without to go through the .
if you , if you 're in your .
i want to you a few of you .
oh , yeah ! you 're all incredible .
if you work with somebody who 's work with the , loves , because of the , i 'm you to see -- .
my are people in the , because i think that every should have 50 million , psychologists , and , and the most common wisdom of the , and most things that you can do for work for happiness , for
this is not my opinion . this is facts .
we know that 80 percent of the percent of the moments that are to 35 to 35 .
that means that eight of 10 decisions , experiences and experiences that live out of life , which is what you 're going to be , you 're going to be .
do n't you want to talk about you 're over 40 .
this group is going to be well , i think .
we know that the first 10 years of a is a impact how money .
we know that 30 than half of americans are married or with the future partner or a relationship .
we know that brain is going to be the and big grow in the and the and to the , which means whatever you want to do , you now time to do this .
we know that the of during the of the , in the , in the life and the women the women are the with the their peak , and they 're 35 to 35 .
so in the , you should be the over the body and the possibilities .
when we think about the development of a child , we know that the first five years for years and are in brain .
it 's time in the , life has a impact on the future .
but we hear about little bit about there 's something like something like the and our are a time .
but the people get to the in the .
the press talking about the the of the .
scientists call the a - .
journalists , the the of people for people in people in the like " the or " the . "
that 's true .
as we have , we have the what the decade is the decade .
the that things that a little bit and a little bit of time .
right ? that 's not true ?
so what happens if you put someone in the head , head and say , " you , you 've 10 years to make a good life ?
nothing .
this person is the the and the and the and it 's not nothing .
and so every day , people in the people like the or like your sons and i my and say something like , " i do n't know my friend does n't know , but that 's not .
or you say , " all , i 've been able to do it for 30 years , it 's all good . "
but later , it sounds like , " my are almost , and i did n't have any the .
i had a better when i had finished college .
and then it sounds like this , " in my , like the journey . jerusalem .
all the and , but fun , but then 30 , the music went out and everybody was , and everybody started to .
i did n't want to be the only ones that i stayed . i sometimes , i my husband , because he was in my chair .
where are the people in the ? here ?
does n't do that .
ok , that 's easy to say , but does n't make mistakes , because it 's about much .
if things is the to the , there 's a enormous pressure to go through a quickly , a city , a city , a partner and two or three children or a lot of time .
many lot of these things are more and like , and just like the the and just the and everything in the .
the does n't mean to buy a red .
it means you want to make the career you want to do .
you can you can n't have this kid , you ca n't want to be able or not ca n't give you .
too many people in the and look at themselves and me and say , " what 's said , " what did i do ? what i ? "
i want to change what people do in the and do .
this is a story that shows how it can .
it 's the story of .
and was in my office when she was 25 , she had a the .
she said she 'd like to work in art or in the , but she had n't decided to have had in the last few years .
because the was , with her friend who more than his .
and even though their were their years before they were much worse .
they often in the , but then she would be up and said , " your family ca n't you , but your friends . "
one day , very , very and almost all the entire hour .
she had bought a and she and she all the morning , she had her deal , but then she came to the that came to the words , " in the , please .
she was almost the when she came me and said , " who 's going to be me if i have a accident ?
who will i me to when i cancer ? "
in the moment , i had to say , " i .
but the real no music , really to look at them .
a needed a better life , and i knew this was her opportunity .
i 've had my first time to my first time , to , like the .
in the next weeks and months , i was three - , i anyone to anyone , whether or man or husband ,
first , all i told , she had no the , she was a very successful .
and i would like to you to something that you would be .
power to something that you for you is an investment , invest in something you want to be next .
i knew no idea about the , no knows how the future of work , but i do : the .
so now time is this job , this , this is , to try to try .
i 'm not the of the but the ones that do n't count , the way , they do n't even have any .
this is the .
i said to , the , but what .
second , i said , the urban the is .
good friends are good are to get to the airport , but the , the with people who are like , they 're what they what they , how they to and how they 're .
this new this new person to the of the outside of outside of the own .
new things are from " , " friends .
it 's true : the half of the is not is not or not .
but the other half is not it , and they the .
half of jobs never . if you 're the boss to your neighbors , your the , not a job .
this is not a little bit of information .
the last advice : what believed that you could not hold the family , but the friends .
this was for her as she was , but as soon as soon as soon as soon as soon she had to her own family , if you 're a partner and family a family .
i said her , a time , a new family , now .
you might think that 's better than better than 20 than 20 or 25 or and i 'll agree with you .
but the person you to or in your life , if everybody else facebook is not an progress .
the best time to your marriage , before you have a , and that means that the same as the in love in love to love in your .
your family , means , the purpose and the thing , and you do n't , because it works , or anybody to the time that you 're just .
so what happened to do ?
we went through her and found them the brilliant of a the who in a in a in a museum .
this weak band is to get her work to get a work .
and that gave her the reason to her friend her to her .
now , five years later , it 's the for museums .
she has a man who she chose .
she loves her new career and her new family and she told me a card , in the , " the line is : " in the , you do n't get enough . "
the sounds like sounds like this is all simple , but that 's what i love about .
it 's so easy to help them .
in the , like the planes are the left , and to west .
and after the , a little bit of make the difference whether you can in or in .
the true of the , the or the , or a good conversation , a great beautiful , a can have a tremendous impact for years and even over generations .
this is an idea that all the that you knows .
it 's just as simple as i said to
i 've the privilege of this such as everyday : the are not the new , so you 're on a , you use your own your own family .
do n't tell you about what you do n't .
you 're just going to live now .
thank you .
in the entire industry , it was always our goal between us and to the relationship between the relationship between the physical world and the world in the screen , where we can our imagination .
and this distance is smaller , smaller , and now it 's smaller than a millimeter that 's a , and computers , and for are become for every .
but i wondered how it would be no at any point .
i looked like what would look like .
first i 've this tool that i in the digital world , so if you focus on the screen , it to the physical character .
designers can put their ideas directly into 3d and surgeons , to can be able to be at the at the screen .
so with this tool , the was so the .
but our hands still remain outside the .
how can we do with the with the digital information , and the of our hands ?
in microsoft , i 've with my mentor the , the computer , a little room of the keyboard in the keyboard of a keyboard .
so that a computer screen and screen can make the of fingers and face , you can put the hands of the keyboard , put the and with the hands .
and there 's windows and a position in the room , you can easily so easily as you a book from a shelf .
then you can get through this book and all of this , and the all the on the of the .
architects can put their hands with both hands and
so in these two examples , we 're going to digital world .
but how would we take that once the and the digital information ?
i 've sure you 've already made a lot of you to read online later .
but now you have to worry about it anymore .
here i have a " .
this is what you 're going to do is you a little bit of your head or your car , or your system that your system looks like your body .
this idea of idea , i started thinking about thinking about the not just in the space , but they make them , so we can them and feel .
how would a look like this ?
in mit media lab , i with my the and my staff the , a the .
now , in this case , this is like a major - in our world , that means that computers , people can move this everywhere -- at least small tiny of this tiny .
effectively , we have the gravity and control the by cheap magnetic , and these .
by creating the object digital program , we it through the through the through the and time , and can make a movements , and in the real world .
so example can be the can be over - the or , or , or , can be and in the real world .
students can use this to use complex concepts of physics and physics and unlike a the or the , or a is a and experience that experience and it 's very powerful .
and yet , more than that , what we have now in computer is to imagine , how the world is going to change our daily activity .
as you can , digital information will not only us to , but to start with us as part of our physical environment , to ourselves of our world .
today , we 've begun by changing the borders , but when we limit the border , the only frontier is our imagination .
thank you .
i was been to for two years , to become a , in the 1970s .
i was in the first grade , wanted to get government for school , all the paid .
but my mother said , " no . "
my parents wanted to engineer how to become .
after they the , they believed that the only way to happiness is to be good and good job .
it 's not important if i do n't like the job or not .
but my dream was to become a chinese .
i 'm that i on my piano .
a - has to start with a very early time , so i tried to go to the .
i wrote even at the and the , and the of the .
but the adult does n't give my idea .
the adults did n't believe it was me .
but my friends had me , but they also as children , as i as myself .
and i 15 years old , i was to with the training .
so my dream would never be true .
i was afraid that i could only take the rest of my life , a second .
but that 's so like this .
so i had to look at my head , to find another .
no one to me to me ?
so i to .
i the my hunger to the with a book with a book and a the of the the , the the tradition , " the " from that book , i learned to be done , " in the "
[ " the " ] [ " ] " the history of " the ] the , i got into the united states , and what did i read first ?
of course , books that are in china .
" the good earth " is the entire life of chinese .
it just simply it as propaganda . i understood .
the bible is interesting , but strange .
but that 's a subject for another time .
but the fifth thing taught me a way of " , " you want your father and your mother . "
" honor " i thought , " that 's so much and much better than a . "
that was my way to the of the and to the relationship to my parents .
through with a new culture , i started to read the the .
this was a to do this .
for example , i did n't really get to really do this because students with this with this .
it never occurred to me that china is not going to be in the center of the world .
so a map tells something about the personal perspective .
the reading is actually nothing new .
in the academic world , it 's a the .
there 's even the like the and the .
comparison and a understanding a .
so i thought , if you read reading about the research in the research , why does n't live in daily ?
so i began to read two books at the same time .
you can say from people -- [ " franklin " by the the , " john " john " david , who was the same , or friends with friends with common with .
[ " we " we " the " -- " life -- is life is a the of the -- stories of various cultures , in the , the , " joseph " ] and the , for example , had
in were in the , the , the political and the nature .
and they were all them together : nature , and social -- interesting .
if you make a physical , it also fun to read the the in languages .
[ " the " for a the " the " the of the water -- the the of the the " the of the the of the , i , i how i can understand how much i can .
i 'm to by , is that , " happiness " happiness " happiness " happiness " happiness "
" in " in means " new "
books are to me like an magical , you through a connection to the people and the present .
i know i 'm never feel more or i 'm feel .
a dream is really nothing to do what has many other .
i 've come to belief that it 's not the only purpose of a true .
his , purpose is to get to , where dreams where our passion our passion , our happiness .
even a dream can this purpose .
because of i 'm here , i 'm here today , happy , with a with life , with life , with most of time .
you 're always to be with .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
when i was eight years old , a new girl in the class , and she was so amazing as girls as girls .
she had the hair and a little the , was good at and .
in the , i decided to get a until i had a the plan .
so i a little longer in a school , a longer , and i was in the .
when the air was , i came into , i went into the classroom , and i took the of the .
and then i did .
i the the notes of my the , just some of some few .
all of the .
when i wanted to make the book , i noticed that some of my other were also played some pretty good grades .
so i in the every day , all of .
i gave all of all of all and i myself because i was also all the time .
i 'm still more about my behavior .
i do n't understand where the thought came .
i do n't understand why i was so good at that .
i felt really good .
i do n't even understand why i never been for it .
it was so obvious .
i was never caught .
but most of me , why does it feel so that little girl was so good at the ?
i 'm not happy .
she 's so , .
we know that babies are under suffering .
and primates , primates . the are nature from nature .
we know that the of the is in the under in the united states .
but i never a study that their or their or their .
so to that , we need to the literature , because the novel is the lab that the in the all the possible forms .
is it a to say that if we do n't have a , no ?
so no the , no the .
no the king , no " from the .
no shakespeare .
because there 's the of the because of , because we 're , " and " the " the , " the , " the . "
no , no the , no , i know that in fashion , say that the answer has everything has , but in the , but he 's really .
this is what we to this is a the , the the of the the for " the time , " and his analysis of the sexual the , the , the thing that we have hope .
think about think , think about feelings . right ?
we think of the little boy that we try to sleep .
we think about a piece of cake , in the .
we forget how to his vision was .
we forget how he is .
these are books are like the as the as the .
i do n't know how the is , but we say , it 's a .
let 's look at why the and the that are the and so well .
is it so obvious that , to -- , such a basis of a story ?
i do n't know . i think it 's just hard to the , because think what happens when we 're .
when we 're , we tell a story .
tell us stories about the lives of other people and they make it bad , because they 're so that it 's bad .
as an artist of the history and the audience we know , what detail the detail to the into the next .
we make all to us , and so that 's to be .
in the first band , " in the world , one of the great , about his and , in the , so , and you will go , " wait ! " i 'm going to be that woman ,
everything that gives me and me joy , might be someone else , even joy , even in that moment . "
this is the story that he tells telling , and from there about the , the that he 's a new , he discovered in his , his in his the .
we 've got to admit that the and the are the .
and friends have to leave the country if they want to with him .
but you do n't need to take a to realize that it hard work . right ?
there 's a .
it 's a feeling that 's to be .
what do the ?
i want to .
i like to .
it 's like the hair and little .
i like to photos .
so , that 's why it 's so successful .
basically , the language of science and science and the .
when these the , suddenly the door , the and he the his the , he this behavior .
he says , " you think that 's a terrible , but it 's not nothing to find a text or a word . "
he says , " there 's scientific worth value . "
and what 's trying to show is that is to make us look , but in your core , you search for the truth , the truth , and the truth , the , the better , the better .
so , that 's for the to the wisdom .
he says , " a woman that we need to us , us a greater and more than islam , a man who 's interested . "
he tells us about us that we should look at women ?
no . i think he 's to say that he tells us to tell us about something .
is there another thing that we us in this particular way ?
even though we feel different our and our and more ?
we can see different with different kinds of behavior ?
freud should be write about it .
one day was a was a by a very young man who was who was by the thought of his thought , his wife .
and freud says , this man is kind of strange , because he does n't even know what his wife does .
because she 's innocent , and everyone knows that .
the poor creature is lower under .
instead , he looking for his wife , no it , .
she to or she to with a man ?
[ freud ] says that the man is to the of the of his wife .
the novel is very good at this point .
the novel describes very well , how much hard us , but not .
because the more we are , the more we to us .
so i think that 's not that we do n't do to do or to do things .
i get to be very .
and i about eight years , but i also think about the story i 've heard in the news .
a woman from michigan was written , she was created by a himself of a the a year , the news messages himself
a year for a year .
she tried to get the new friend of her shoes into her shoes , and i to hear , when i heard , i was with .
because ... let 's be honest .
what does it mean , creativity , creativity , right ?
this is something of a novel .
this is something from a novel of the .
the is one of my favorite .
she 's the the and the woman who 's the american .
from her is the two of in the train , and the the mr. the , " books that how to -- to keep our spirit , and we 're in the realm of the , that in between the between the what that could be -- could
take a the , your character .
first , all , you want to be tom , and they have , and he 's what they had , and they 're like by the , and he 's on their name , he name her , he 's her .
this is a method .
but what do we do ? we ca n't do it as tom as tom .
i ca n't give the world , even though i 'd like to do it for some days .
it 's a shame because we live in a time .
we live in a " - time era . time .
we are all good social media that are currency for the , is right ?
does the novel the ? i 'm not sure .
but we do what do if they do n't if they 're in a .
so we go to the street and ask questions to the .
think about the , think about his the as a professor , this great .
but i always [ ] , the boss of the with the face of a face , the the needs , needs , needs , needs , but it 's him to him .
that 's me familiar .
so , needs his help , help him and the stories of stories in front of the stories .
but as you start to start starting to change something , and eventually in " the six - the , " as the , and with the with its solution , the to and say , " we 're not the on them , mr. the .
we 're proud them . "
and he 's that there 's no - the - the , that would not shake the shake .
that 's one of the few times that we can see in the stories , and i think these little very , but also , .
it seems like it 's not a , but a problem .
in a moment , a moment on a different like .
and in the next moment , they 're on a an open .
suddenly , it to this , he has to him .
is it really easy ?
what if really only a problem , if it just how we deal with the other relationship ?
maybe we would n't be to be a .
we could make us look at .
but i like the .
while we 're waiting for that , we still the literature as a as .
literature alone , the .
literature alone , they can , they .
and who 's all the : the good news , the the tom , the the , the , the .
we 're in society .
thank you .
i was about 10 years old , and on a the - old with my father in the father , a the in the northern of the new york .
it was a great day .
the forest .
the sun would look at the petals the leaves like the , and if no have been , you would have almost to be that we were the first people who are through these .
we came to our the .
i saw the little hut on a cliff and across a the , beautiful lake , as something like something .
behind the roof , a one , four , four square , with the , the and a old the .
i was amazed , i was angry and confused .
the were too lazy to the , what they had -- who they thought , would they would to ?
the question was me and i asked them , and i was them .
who we to ?
how do you also or where " might be like who are behind us behind us in ?
who 's behind us behind us in rio or in paris or in london ?
here in new york new york the , every day of day , tons of tons and tons of tons .
i wanted to them -- individuals .
i wanted to understand who job the job .
how is it to wear a uniform and wear ?
so i started to with a .
i drove with the , the and went to in and in the city , and i learned a lot , but i was still a .
i had to go deeper .
so i took a job as a the .
i was not just the same . i was the .
and i was the mechanical and the snow . snow .
it was a wonderful privilege and a experience .
everybody asks after the .
he 's there , but not as you think , and in days , it really bad , you 're pretty fast to get very quickly .
and the thing that you to do is just hard .
i know people who were this number of years , and their bodies still on weight that they 're on to body , tons of every week .
and then there 's danger .
after statistics of the , of the , the country in the country , and i learned why .
you 're all the entire day , all over the , all over .
everybody wants to and often do n't have to .
that 's really bad for workers .
and the garbage itself is full of the that the from the the and terrible .
i learned about the the of the .
if you look from the the , and from the of the city of a city , you can see that is like a self - itself .
he does n't listen to .
it 's also like a kind of or .
he has to be in movement .
and then there 's the stigma .
you put the uniform and , somebody -- whatever -- whatever -- because you 're going to take the traffic or your or to you can turn your coffee in your apartment , and you come and you and you say , you do n't
i think this particular because i believe in the that the of the are the most important in the streets of the city .
they are the of the public health .
if you do n't waste the waste , every day and efficient , and it would take out of the the and the and the would continue us to very .
diseases that we 've been for decades and decades , and , and would spread and us .
the economy takes it .
if we do n't take the old , we do n't have a place for the new , the motors of the of the world is the is the .
i do n't change the capitalism , i just to the .
and then that 's what i call our , .
and that 's how i just as we as we today .
we do n't care about why our the our , our or our , or to our .
we take them , throw away , forget , because we know people on the other side , that 's care about .
so , i want to share today a few ways today , how to think about how to think about the and to make them into this conversation , how you create a city that are sustainable and .
your work , i think , is kind of the .
you see the streets every day .
they carry in many cities .
you know when you expect to it .
and their work does our .
they 're like a the .
the that you 're , us ourselves before our , our , and the and this has to be more to any price .
on days after september , i was the of a the on the street , and my son and ran the and there was a man who his , he every .
and i tried to him for him -- day , day days , but i started to cry .
and he looked at me and said , " everything 's fine . "
" everything is fine . "
first later , i started to start my research and met the husband .
his name is the , and we worked together , we eventually got good friends .
i wanted to believe that the was right .
everything is fine .
but in our efforts , change the way we to this planet as we need to be able to cost the cost of including the cost of cost , the very cost of the .
and we have to be able to do the people who do work , the experience , how we think about the systems that we 've been , and that is the last 40 years of the and the world that we can be on to species of
the , we think about when we talk about , three percent of the national .
it 's a remarkable statistic .
in your daily , in your life , your next time you see somebody , whose job is to make them make , take a moment time you 're .
take a moment to turn it .
hello , hi , what goes ?
that 's not enough .
hello , hi , what goes ?
my name is the and i 'm not drunk , but the doctor in my birth .
he 's got six directions and me little , the air .
so i what i 've learned is what i means i 'm going to do .
look .
it 's an amazing . i 'm a of the , and .
it 's not genetically .
it 's not a the . you ca n't get it .
nobody has the of my mother 's mother , and i did n't get it because parents are the first ones that are .
you get through accidents , like the who 's born in my birth .
i have to warn you . i 'm not a source of inspiration , and i do n't want anybody to me to me with me because you 've all seen in a point in your life .
so , just to go .
it 's just a christmas in christmas in the mall . and the is looking at the looking for a and what you see ?
the .
and you think , " why ca n't i be a little bit of ? "
i have to say you , i 'm i 'm problems , and i 'm only one of them .
if there was a of , i a .
i 'm a the , and i live in new jersey .
now if you do n't feel better , you do n't know .
the park in new jersey is my hometown .
i love the fact that my favorite and my have the same .
and also , i love the fact that i could go to my home in my new york city . if i wanted to .
many people do n't run with hot , but my parents do n't feel a . "
the mantra of my father was , " yes , you can . can . "
so if my three older sisters , i 'm with .
when my three older sisters had to go down to school , parents , to , so i could go , and if we were not all of the the , we all the the the of my mother .
my dad taught me to work when i was five by using his feet on his feet .
another one was another , was to a of camera in front of my nose , so i to .
my was the was very strong , and as -- yeah , the first day in the kindergarten , i was like a who was a to a much .
there was only six only in my city , and all of my family were all my family .
today , we are 20 in the city , and they still my family .
i think no one has ever noticed that we do n't have a .
this was before 9/11 before and before it was for a , " i hate to use as a as a .
people i grew up with , i did n't have with my faith .
but they were very concerned that i could possibly maybe could possibly .
i explained that i was going to live three months , so i was the from the to a .
i have the .
yes , on the . crazy .
my parents could n't afford to afford , so they sent me to the .
i learned how to make on the , so i can walk on .
and i 'm from the , where it really important to be , so if my friends , if you were , .
and if my friends your friends to the coast of the , i do n't .
i spent my summer in summer because i had my parents were afraid that we if we could n't get every single summer , day , day .
the the often that my dad wanted me , so i used to milk of the , and into the dead sea , and i know how the water in the eyes , and i thought , " it worked ! it worked ! "
but we found a the , we found .
i have to say it 's really boring , but before i did , i was a , not a not a .
now i can stand on the head .
my parents always me that i would be able to be a dream not a dream , and my dream was to be the general .
because of the , of i a great scholarship of the the , the university state university , because i 'm every minority of .
i was a the of the the of the .
all loved me .
i do n't like all of homework do n't so much , all of all of all of , in all of their the .
every time i a scene from the , my teacher .
but i never got a role .
so in my the , the end , a piece of the title " she dance to really .
a piece of a girl with a .
i was a girl with a .
so i everywhere , " finally , i get a role !
i have a !
finally !
thank god , thank you to be free ! "
i did n't have the role .
the brown had got the role .
i was to the of the the , i the , when someone had my cat , and she asked why she said me , she said me that i would n't want to do the .
i said , " sorry , but if i ca n't do the , then you ca n't do the character . "
i was born in the role , and she gave them a without a .
the the life .
hollywood is known for known to physically healthy to play .
after i went back to my first part of my first role was a .
my dream was true .
and i knew i was soon to say "
but instead , i was a the that was only the only , and i realized that the did n't have a ,
they just perfect people .
but i 'm afraid of the .
i grew up with the , the and the and , and all of these women had a common : they were the .
so i became a the .
my first job was to famous from new york city new york new york , and i 'm never going to face the face of the first time i ever forget , he was that in the street to new york with a with
i 've been in america , in the united states , i 've also been in the middle east on arabic , the and the .
some people say , i 'm the first the in the arab world .
i do n't like to ask the first , but i know that you never heard about the bad little bit of bad that women are not , and they find us to .
2003 , 2003 , my brother from father and father , dean the , and i was to the new yorker new american that now to be a .
our goal was to the most exciting image of americans in the media and to at the time that , and , not .
the of the was much more than the challenge the of .
my big breakthrough was in 2010 .
i was been to the in " the "
i like to the , she 'd me into a studio and me to a chair .
so i looked at the the , and said , " sorry , can i get another chair ? "
and she looked at me and she said , " five , four , two , two ...
and we were live ! live !
so i had to go on the table of the , so i did n't get the screen , the time , and when the interview was , i was .
there was my chance , and i had her , and i knew that i never me back .
but mr. the invited me , but he made me a and my .
at work with keith , i 've learned something learned , : all the people are internet .
people say , kids are more , but as a kid or adults , or never been me about me .
in the world wide web , i 'm with my of the .
when i look at online , i see like , " the , why this ? "
" the , is the the ? "
and my favorite : " the .
did you have ?
we should be for them . "
even , my in the the : the , the , the .
a disability is as it .
if a ca n't play , play ca n't play .
the are the biggest -- yes . that 's a worth value .
people are the biggest minority in the world , and we 're the in the .
the doctors said , i never walk , i 'm sitting here front of you .
but i would be with social media , i would n't be here .
i hope that we can put a picture of in the media and in the .
maybe there 's no way to be no at the internet when the more difficult to more positive .
or maybe not .
maybe it 's still a to a good .
my journey has led me to a few of places .
i put on the red next red next to red the and the and the .
i a film in a film with adam the and with my , with the great african - based .
i 'm as a the - with the the - the - to - the -
i was a the - in new york city in the national center .
i 've been a the 's , who 's trying to give the to give you a chance of my parents .
but the one that moment most of the most -- before this -- the moment that i was in the man , like a and a bee , the way , and the way that i do .
this was the only time that my father ever seen me and me and i 'm to talk to him this talk .
: god your soul , your dad , dad . my name is the , " if i can , can you can . "
there was a time we 've been big .
on the 21st , july was the from the apollo and , and the ocean of the .
armstrong and the were alone , but her had on the of the same , the peak of a the , the .
the the was the largest in history of the united states of america .
to the , about billion dollars a three billion dollars , or four percent of the the .
apollo was created for people and the the collaboration of companies , universities and universities .
people died , including the of the apollo .
but until the end of the end , 24 people to the moon .
from the that its surface , is , after the last year , now the oldest .
why did they go ?
they did n't go back to go back to the the and something which all the 24 later -- a new sense of that our home is small and small .
why did they go ? the they went , because president had the to show the that his had the better .
but the on words of words in the university of the , give a better .
for was not a was not just a of the east during the cold war .
at the time , this was a feeling of feeling of the sense of the of the technology .
it was a to because it was something great .
the the - a - a - a - long - of long - century .
from the first half of the 20th century , the and the and , and a against a .
in the middle century , polio and smallpox .
technology seemed to something that the a the .
for most of the human history , we could n't even be able to be a horse or a boat , a , but in the , the apollo 10 miles per hour .
since 1970 , no have been human beings on the moon .
no one has ever faster than the of the apollo , and the optimism is about the power of power is the , the problems that we 've had to , to clean energy , or the world , or the world , to the
i remember as a as a as a the , .
the of the apollo was saw me and my mother me not to very the in the the .
i had a idea that this was the last final , but i was sure i was going to be in my life .
the the , something with our ability to deal with problems with technology to become a .
you hear it everywhere .
we 've heard it in the last two days .
it 's a that if we had a hard and ourselves with , with things like things and social media , or social media , or algorithms , the the .
it 's nothing wrong with these things .
they have our lives and .
but they do n't solve the big problems of humanity .
what happened ?
there 's a explanation from silicon , where you have that in less time , chinese , than in years , intel , microsoft , apple and the .
in silicon valley in the valley , you are markets , in particular , the special companies , the company companies .
silicon valley says that have gone to engage , to engage , ideas , and , and problems .
but this explanation is not good enough .
it explains mainly what does n't happen with silicon .
even their times , tiny , tiny , a 10 years ago .
investors had always been to invest in technologies like energy , which is a , and development and , never , the development of the problems that have no value to solve .
no , the reasons why we ca n't solve a problem , complicated and more and more .
sometimes we do n't consciously to the big problems .
we could fly to mars when we want .
nasa , even a plan .
but to be a real decision , public decision , public , and so it 's never going to happen .
we 're not going to fly to mars because everybody thinks there 's be there are on the earth there are be done .
another time we can do n't solve the problems because our political systems .
today , less than two percent of the earth 's earth , sources , solar wind , wind , less than two percent , and the reason is very small .
coal and gas are cheaper than solar wind and wind and cheaper is cheaper than cheaper .
we all want to alternative that can make the , but no exist .
now it 's so that , and all of the same time , the same opinion of what national and international development , the development of the , is that economic development in the development and development and a the price of
but in the current political , there is no hope that the u.s. of the u.s. or the international the and the .
sometimes are more problems that sounds , but not .
it was long time believed that the of the .
but 30 years research has taught us that political impact .
technologies can things like systems like systems and , and , but it 's going to be a , there are no governments in governments .
eventually , sometimes we 're going to change the solutions , because we do n't understand .
president , the was told the war , but you discovered that there are many of the that of the most effective against therapy , and only for years last years , to be in the .
difficult problems are difficult .
it 's not true that we ca n't solve to deal with technology .
we can , we have to , but to have these four elements , the politicians , politicians and politicians must be interested in order to solve a problem , the need to solve the problem ; we need to understand it .
the that became a metaphor for the to the ability to solve the big , to make the .
but this is a model that ca n't happen in the future .
it 's not the year - year - year .
there 's no battle struggle like the cold war , no politicians like john kennedy , who 's all the and to a , and no sense of the like the of the .
but in the , it was just end up to moon .
he was only three days .
and it 's really unlikely that whether it really has a serious problem .
we 're ourselves and the solutions the future of getting will be to be .
god knows , it does n't be us to challenges .
thank you .
i want to you your eyes .
imagine you 're your .
and the door , their color and the material made out of them .
now , you a group of the - on - grade .
it 's a the - the , and you come to your and your .
you to imagine this .
they the up , and , and to you .
and then they all directly your .
bicycles , all the and the in the .
now , the in your or what on the other side of your brain , and , as the in the room .
the light seems to the .
it 's you from your desk to a .
one horse .
you can almost feel like his blue gets your nose .
you the the the , it into the mouth .
go over the , in .
here is you to your .
her clothes just the , she said , " the first the of the , while she on your the .
now , i 'm going to your kitchen .
the ground was replaced by a yellow the , and it 's come out of the , the the , and the the of " from the ' , " in hand .
okay . now , open the eyes .
i want to tell you a very competition who year in new york in new york city .
it 's called " the .
a few years ago , i wanted to learn from this of as a the of and , the of the the .
it was a bunch of new and a few of a few of and very and .
they 're looking for hundreds of numbers .
the of the of the and of and of the and
and it 's just in just a few minutes .
they the about who the of a the of a the - the .
this is crazy .
these people have skills .
i started to with some of you .
this is ed , a guy who 's out of england , and there 's a of the the .
and i asked him , " ed , when you noticed you have this particular ? "
and ed said , " i 'm not a the .
i just have a average memory .
everybody who 's here , you 'll tell you that he 's just a .
we 've all , techniques , the the of the , the two - two years ago , the techniques that used to , and , and the to build the books to books
and i just thought , " wow , how does it have heard of it ? "
we stood outside out of the the and , wonderful , brilliant , and funny , english says , me , " josh , you 're a american journalist .
you know , you ? "
i said , " what ? what ? " ? "
" i 'd like to the how to give the order of a the - the .
it would be the world prove that everybody can . "
i told him , " i 'm not , but i but i teach me to teach me .
i mean , you 've got to start somewhere , right ?
and this was the beginning of a very strange journey for me .
so , one of the next year , i spent , i spent , i 'm not just to my memory , but also to understand it and understand how it works , why it does n't work and what could be .
i 've a lot of really interesting people .
this is for example , this is example , for example ,
he 's suffering under the and probably the worst memory of the world .
his memory is so bad that he does n't even be to be his .
although though it was so tragic , he to it how much our memory our we are .
on the other side of the spectrum , i learned to the side of the spectrum .
i 'm familiar with .
he was the most of for the the in the movie film . "
we spent a afternoon to the public in lake city .
and i came back to a whole of flying over the memory , two years ago , and in the and in the in the .
and i really a whole bunch of interesting things .
especially me that there was a time to the to the , not nearly as much as .
there was a time to people in their memory , it 's a the .
over the last few decades , we 've a series of technologies -- from the , to the the , the , the computer , the smartphone -- it 's us easier to our , human ability to
these technologies have our world , the , but we changed us .
they 've us , and i would argue that they 've also changed us .
without the need to , seems sometimes , as we as we forget .
one of the last places that earth , where you still find people who still are passionate , and , and , is unique .
in fact , he 's not as unique , there are the like this around the world .
and this has me in the , i wanted to know how these people do this .
a few years ago , a university at university london brought into a lab .
you wanted to know : is the structure or anatomy of brains differently than the rest of us ?
the answer was : no .
are you smarter than we ?
she gave them a the , and the answer was : did n't .
there was a interesting and a interesting difference between the brain and a and a with a
if you put them in a and , brain , as you can , faces and pictures of images , you can see that the regions of the regions of the brain than the rest of us , the rest of us .
it seems like you 're using the part of your device using the and using it .
why ? and we learn from learn something ?
the to the memory is a kind of a - , a year , every year , with a new technology to a more to more of and more rest of the rest .
this is my friend ben the , the .
on the front of him , 36 , he , he himself within an hour with an technology that he invented and as a .
he 's a technology to the of the the , in a half an hour .
yeah . yes .
and even though there 's a kind of techniques , to put things together in these the , but all of the techniques on the concept , the psychologists called the .
this is so much about this concept , this particular , is how follows : if i look at the same , to tell you , and tell you , " tell you that there 's a person called the west . "
this is his name .
and i say , " you , there 's a person who 's a . "
now , if i go back to a moment now , you say , " you know the word that i 've ever met you before
you know what you 've got ? "
the person who person who person the person who is the , to remember more likely to be the word than the person who person who person the person .
same word , the , that 's weird .
what 's going on ?
well , the name of means is nothing .
he 's absolutely all of all the the that in your head .
but the profession of the , we know .
so , wear to white .
so , have a their hands .
so smell are good at home when they come from work .
maybe we may even have a .
and when we hear the word first , we 'll use this to with the word and the it , it later .
the secret of what in the , and the to be able to realize better , to the of the into the , -- that a no one has no sense in meaning in meaning in sense ways to meaning and
one of the techniques can two 500 years back to the .
she was known as the known .
the story of his story is like : there was a poet called the who a the .
he was been for the because of the , because when you really wanted to really a really big , you , you a .
he 's his poem from the memory and the room , in the right moment , the moment behind him and all of the .
not only all dead , your bodies are to the the .
nobody one can say who was nobody , nobody knows where who has .
the body can not be properly .
it 's an tragedy after the other .
the 's outside , the of the of the disaster , he 's his eyes and suddenly he suddenly that he can see his front eye , where
and so he 's the hand of hand , and it causes to the .
in this moment , moment , something that we all know that we do n't know how much we , or , we can , we have a very good and memory .
i would like to ask you to first the first 10 words of history of you , you find it hard to find it .
but i bet if i ask you to remember , who remember , in the moment , a horse in your horse in your in your horse , you might have the .
the idea of the is to be a building of the inner eye and it with images of the things that are -- the , the , the , the , is as a picture of it as it memory .
this is a advice that wrote over two years old , the is about to memory .
so how does it work ?
you 're invited to talk at ted talk , and you keep it memory , as it would have been , he had been the to over two years ago .
you 're like to imagine you imagine your .
imagine a secret crazy and crazy story with the pictures , and to remind you that first thing about this completely crazy talks .
and then you put your house and you see the on the back of mr. .
and that would remind you to start your friend ed .
and if you look at color , you to a you that you tell you .
you put in your kitchen , and the fourth thing about you 're talking about this was journey that you for a year , and you 've got friends you to remember you remember .
so , this research did n't know their the -- not word for word , word , but subject for topic .
the english term " the , " the theme of comes from the greek word " the "
these are some of those people when people about and in terms of
the " first " in your first place . "
i was just all this , and i 'm still and i 'm still and
some of the .
i wanted to write something about this the of the the .
but there was a problem .
the problem that the are the are .
it 's like a group of people who sitting and write a test .
it 's already exciting when somebody who are the .
i 'm journalist , i need something to do something about .
i know that the things in the people are in the people , but i do n't have access to it .
so if i wanted to tell this story , i had to position .
and so i began to every morning every morning 20 minutes before i started with my newspaper , something to learn something .
maybe a poem or maybe a poem or poem or
the names of a old the that i bought on the .
i had to think that it was a fun .
i could never imagine .
it 's fun because it 's not about to memory .
you 're always better and get these crazy , crazy , and hopefully , images from your mind .
i 'm in it .
here i 'm with my the .
a few of and a the that were up to two little of , because the greatest enemy of the is the .
i went to the same i had a year after a year , i used to be a year .
and i 'm to me , just as a experiment .
it could be a nice - for my .
the problem was that the experiment did n't like as a .
i won the , which , which really , should n't have should .
it was nice to and , and , but that was not what i wanted to do .
that 's just tricks .
and the work because they work on some simple ideas about the the of our .
you do n't have to build a - or - or - to - to - to - to - to - to - to - to - to - to - .
we often talking about people with memory , it 's a special , but that 's not true .
good are the .
we 're going to better things better when we look .
we remember we 're getting .
we remember , if we have the opportunity to figure out why information and experience experiences , they can have meaning , and , and if we can them into something that 's in our sense of our , we can the " the "
the the , these the , they all .
in fact , it 's not real .
they work because they work us to work .
they 're us to be and , in a way we 're not usually .
but there are not shortcuts .
that 's how things happens to memory . memory .
one thing i want to you with you is something that i 'm through by the man that man does n't be to his the , learned , our lives are the of our memories .
how much are we willing to make our lives , our own , our , our iphone , to us to talk about us , how much are we 're , because we are so lazy that we do n't want to the and ?
i learned that memory , in any of us , incredible has evolved .
if we want to live a life , we have to be the person who do n't know to .
thank you .
at the age of 27 , i went to a job in the the of a the , .
in public schools in schools in new york , i to the .
as every teacher i , i and i and .
i was homework .
as the work , i , i .
and was not the only difference between the best and worst .
the , my some of my students were not students .
some of my kids do n't really get well .
that 's me .
what you 're in the same time , in , is difficult to do : bad numbers , the , the area of a .
but not n't that these concepts . i was sure that i that all my students all students all the students , to learn and hard and hard .
after some years , i went to the conclusion , i , we a lot of understanding for learning students and learning from a perspective of motivation , from a psychological perspective .
what we do is we is the is the is , but what if , in and life , much more than the ability to learn and learn ?
so i went the classroom and a to .
i started to kids and adults in all sorts of all , all of time , and i , who is successful and why ?
my and i went to the west .
we were trying to predict what would be the the .
we went to national and the to the children would be .
we studied the that worked in very tough very , and asked them to the teachers who were going to the , and they were able to improve the of their students .
we were partnerships with and , who are their to their .
and who would make the most money .
in all these different ways , they 've seen an individual as a and a success .
it was not social intelligence .
it was n't good , physical health .
it was brilliant .
and is and for is very long - term .
we is a .
and is when you to a - , a week , a month , but for years , and really hard to work to this plan .
you know , is like a marathon .
i was in .
i asked thousands of students the of the , to the , and then they to come up a year to see who was done .
it showed that kids with kids are with the kids are more likely to make the , even if i can all the properties , things like , as a , even as they did in school .
so , is not only not in and , but in school , but in school , especially with children .
the of this topic is for me is that we know so little that science as little bit about how to it .
every day , parents and teachers teacher , " how do we study kids of children ? "
how did i teach to see a ?
how do i do it for ? "
the answer response : i do n't know .
what i know is that you do n't have to be in .
our data show that a lot of people do not to be able to do .
in fact , in is not necessarily not necessarily not necessarily not necessarily , but even , even with talent .
so far the best idea that i 've been learned from the of the , is called the the .
this idea was been involved at stanford university of research and the belief that the ability to learn is not to , but they can change their change .
dr. the that when you read about the brain and learn how to change and how to change and how much , because they do n't believe that failure is a state condition .
this is an idea of the .
but we need more .
i want like to finish my finish , we 're already so far .
this is the work that lies us .
we need to best and .
we have to measure whether we succeeded , we have to be willing to have to learn and learn from lessons .
in other words , we need to learn to kids our kids .
thank you .
in the center of my work is connected to our lives and to part of the environment , architecture from the natural , local conditions , and traditions .
today , i example , as example , i projects , projects .
both of projects are in , in ethiopia and one of tunisia .
they also have that the different of different perspectives of different perspectives are part of the brain .
the first example of started was a invitation , a - in capital .
this is the kind of building that we us , my team and me , as an example of what we should .
first , i thought i wanted to .
after we saw some of these buildings -- there 's a lot of them in the city -- we that they have three of the features .
first , these are these buildings , they 're very large , they do n't afford to buy things .
second , you need a lot of energy because surfaces are the glass , the heat , inside the inside , and then you need a lot of the .
in a city where not should happen , because they pretty weather that in between 20 to 25 .
and thirdly , you have n't got their with and to do .
this is a place in a place called a rich culture and tradition .
and also , i was really our first really of the old with the old market with this the , thousands of people and , and , day , day in a little bit of day .
it has also this idea of space that uses the the uses to create activity .
so i thought , this is exactly what i really want to design , not a .
but the question was , how we could build a building , building with these principles .
the next challenge came to we did , because it 's in a city town of the city , most of the buildings that you were on there , not there .
there 's two that have about hundreds of meters .
first we created a connection between these two streets , and all the of the building .
this is a - the - the , that a building that creates that its own shape and its own and .
so to get this - , we the idea of a with a little with the little that in every , because of the shape of the change .
i also think , how do we like the building ?
i really wanted to find a solution to the local .
i started thinking about think like a like a out of concrete in the that which the air , and the light , but in the form .
then i 'm these buttons in the the .
they have the properties of a geometry , and that helped me to the entire .
we 're building this with these little , the that air and light on in the into the buildings .
and this is being through these little , the light from the to building the building at night .
it was n't just simply the to with these ideas , because they thought , " this is not a not - mall . that did n't have . "
but then we realized that we 've been is this idea of the idea of the idea of a , because the can be able to sell more .
the concept of the was a much , much more , because not just because of the material compared , but it because we because we had no longer .
so we created some the - that we used to project .
first time was to think about how to make the building , in a city , almost a day .
we created a contribution called by on the roof .
under these the , we this the as a new space with space and with that this .
these - on the roof the water to the to the .
hopefully at the beginning of the next year , because we have the to the five , and .
the second example is a the - of - in - in and in
so to be a big project , the biggest project i 've ever designed , i had to understand the city of really , but also the environment , the tradition , the culture .
as i analysis , i , i particular , the , the - old structure , which was a by the wall of a , through 12 , and through by the way , and was just by the .
and i was to the first step , the first step to build the existing of the to create the first 12 of with large size and like the in and in other cities in these cities .
so , we , we some points in the at the of this and with lines , and the changed the original pattern .
the final step was to think about the , the cell , the , as a as part of the .
what would the best in a - climate - to - a - ?
this is the , because of the between the two the that created , and is an natural the .
so we put a pattern about this , the most that most of the most that are in .
and that 's the result , it 's almost like a combination of a european and arab .
there are the with the and in the , there are all these sorts of things .
it also the local that which to higher density in the upper and a lower density in the .
it also the concept of the .
the volume has this shape form , which has evolved through three different , and also in very dense light into the , in three , a and a and a of the activity that are activity into
the roof , my the project in this project , the community 's almost the room that will going to build the building .
there can be all the neighbors and , and make things like a the - morning , a building to a building .
these two examples have a common approach to a common approach .
they 're in emerging in which you can see the cities literally .
in cities , the changes of architecture in the in the today and future life will people the local communities and as the buildings grow .
and that reason , i think it 's important architecture that architecture , but solutions , the that the relationship between the community and the environment , to nature and connecting .
thank you .
i want to talk about trust , and i want to talk to the opinions .
they 're so ubiquitous to they become used to become .
there 's one of my view of my .
first of all : is trust in the , many .
then we goal , we need to trust more confidence .
and a task is , we should rebuild the confidence .
i think the goal and the challenge to the wrong .
i want to give you a different story about a claim , a goal and a better approach to the .
first of all , the other thing : why do you trust ?
and if i really talk to my knowledge , i know , i do n't know the answer .
maybe in some , or some or , or in some other .
i 'm not going to be .
but i can look at the extreme places that the are the believe that the is .
look at a time , you 're a lot of to .
and will be people who people 20 years ago , mainly journalists , and , and still .
and the people who 20 years ago , that was very , still very , .
we 're in between the , and the almost the almost in the middle .
but is that a good proof ?
the - -- .
what could you be doing ?
so you look at the general mindset of people , when you 're going to be certain questions .
trust politicians ? trust ?
now , if you asked somebody , trust ?
do you trust the the ?
do you trust the the ?
and then , would you 'd like to ask , " ? "
and that would be a reasonable response .
and if you understand the answer to you , you might say , " i 'm you some of you , but you 're not . "
totally rational .
in short , we 're in our short lives , we 're in different ways of ways .
we do n't think we 're that we every or in a or in a
so i might say about that i had a particular given , i 'm a , first grade , i , i would n't want to make the .
maybe i know i know that i do n't know that you 're not going to be good car .
i 'm that my friend a on a , but not that she that she 's a secret .
simple .
so , we know from our everyday , how different can look , but why do we know this knowledge when we think about ?
the situation are there are very bad about the actual , because they ignore the sense of which you 're to the .
second , we get to target .
the goal is to more .
honestly , i think this is the stupid .
i would n't going to be .
i would try to do the more confidence , but not n't .
i 'm not allowed to do it .
and those of you , your would put into your hands of a certain of , who would like the , the , " the " but then , " i think , " i think , much more
" trust is not a the goal in this life .
trust and to be to be the goal .
and then you say , yeah , okay , what is the most important is not trust , but it .
the people from people .
and to do that , we need to look at three things .
are you ? are you ? are you ?
when we get a person in the themes , and we can find , we have a good reason to trust , they 're .
but that 's not a person , but probably not .
some of my friends are and i , i 'd like to do a letter , because they are the .
i have friends who are very in their own , but they 're to do .
and i 'm very happy about that i do n't have a lot of friends who are and , but .
if you have , i did n't even have it .
but after that we , we , trust .
trust is the reaction .
the we have to do that , of course , that 's hard .
over the last decades , we 've been trying to design the in all sorts of all and experts and experts and that it to us to make their lives .
many of these systems have the effect .
they do n't work like .
a the said once said to me , " the problem is that the longer takes to the world . "
everywhere in our public institutions , our institutions , our , our problem , this problem . this is to and , but to make the , but to the opposite .
it 's people like people 's their tasks by taking them to .
i can , can any of any examples .
so 's what 's going to .
the goal is more , and that 's difficult to be if we want to be able to want to communicate and other , and if we want to whether or people or , politicians , politicians ,
it 's not easy . you have to make it . simple reactions or do n't .
and now to do .
this as a as of the describe , describe , the .
because it 's that you should trust and i trust .
we can do this for ourselves .
we can go a little bit more .
so 's how two people can improve their confidence .
but ultimately , it 's a lot of that 's being done by another .
you ca n't do that again what else can do .
you have to give you a basis that you trust .
so you have to be .
that 's of course , of course , you do n't usually all of people at the nose .
but they also have to have the that they are .
how does this ?
that happens every day , everywhere . people do , very effective .
here 's a simple example of example .
the store , i my , she put me up and she ask no questions .
you take them back and give me back to me , or a few of the in the .
that 's great . i 'm you , you 've been shown to me .
there 's a morality of morality .
you think of the as vulnerable , is a very good that you 're being , and you to be your own words .
so our goal is not really very difficult to see .
it 's relationships between people , and when it 's , and if the other is .
so the story of the story is much less much about trust or about the faith , the or the or the , or much more about , and how you people , and evidence of the own .
thank you .
you know , the best thing i 'm most for me is the films i can look .
i love my own my with my with my kids , my daughter was four years old , we 've got together , " the of . "
the film did n't have more .
her , of course , was the .
so she had a good excuse to wear a the dress , and a the .
but if you look at this film , you look at , you see how it is .
we live in today and our children in a kind of a - a - size .
but " the was .
he did n't have this trend .
it has 40 years to go through this trend , -- a different movie , a guy from a and a guy with a girl , you just as the of the the .
you know , i know what i 'm talking about ?
right .
well , there 's a big difference between these two films , even several differences between the of " and all the movies that we 're today .
first of all , there 's " in the ' " of " very violence .
the monkeys are pretty aggressive , as the as the .
but i think if the had been by the now , today , said , said , " the , you know , you 're the the of that once us .
use your shoes to by computers , the evil of evil of the west . "
but it 's not happening .
another point i 'm the " is " is " unique , is that the and are more characters .
this is what i saw the first time when i was my star , " and was years later , and was different .
at that point , i was a son .
he was at three years old .
he was n't invited to this . he was too young .
but he was the second child , and he was less than his sister .
so he 's a , and he 's the film , he 's a his mother 's mother , and i do n't think he 's understood what he was going on , but he it 's in .
and i asked what he was doing .
did he the it to courage , courage and ?
did he the that a army a army to the government ?
he 's that there 's only in the in the , and , of course , who 's really cool , but most of time , that you can do with a with a student and a to the
compare this with " the of " .
how does your the your to your good ?
by connecting with all the the and a the .
this is the kind of world i mean my children would be -- , -- and not in the world , who are struggling to do what 's going to our world today .
why does it so much power -- the kids that are doing our children , and so few of the the ?
there 's a lot of good literature about the impact that about the boys at the boys , and they should read them . they 're very good .
but i did n't read much about that , like boys with this .
i know from a experience that the could n't be the model that i could have to find the world of adults , in girls and girls in common .
i think there was this moment with the first kiss , when i really expect that the the starts , because that ends a movie , right ?
i 've my , i 've the girl .
why do you see there ?
i do n't know what to do .
the movies are very to the and to their , and there 's not a lot of space for other relationships and other .
it does almost like as a young animal is and if you 're a girl , you better to get better .
there are exceptions of exceptions , and i 'm going to be the of you .
but they give a message to the young kids that boys are not the .
they 're real to teach the girls how to the , but they do n't show the boys to the way they 're to the .
there 's no way for you .
there are also some women who are writing to write the stories for our kids and are also , and they 're still more .
and the most common studio of all the of the , is , after each other , and every one of them is a of a young or a man , or two of men who are friends , and son , or two of men who are
until , as many of you think -- this year when they finally the movie " -- the - the .
i recommend him all of him . he 's on the internet .
remember , what the said , " the ?
" oh , i ca n't believe that has made a . "
it 's very good . do n't take it that .
but as well , none of these movies has the .
i do n't know if you 've heard about it .
he has n't really have to this , and to be , but maybe we 're going to start to start a today .
the is a the and in the middle of the this conversation that she with a friend of the films that had seen .
it 's just simple . there 's only three questions you need to ask : there 's more than one character in the movie , which is and something ?
try to get that one .
and do women talk to the time of the time ?
and what 's their about their entertainment to do something like the guy , they like ?
i mean . thank you .
thank you .
two women who exist and talk about anything .
this is what happens . i saw it , and yet i see it pretty rare in the movies that we know and love .
in fact , i went to the beginning to see me a very good movie , " the .
you remember ? much of the in the the , great the , general , about what a good - is a good - .
it falls with the with the .
i think that should n't be because of the majority of the -- i do n't know if you 've seen it -- but a lot of the in a message where men and women are women during the .
there are some good scenes that men in men in this deep , and , and the great moment , one of the the , is to go through a door and say , " you go to bed , " ? "
this is some way to some of .
so let 's look at the numbers .
in 2011 , under the 100 - year - , movies , what do you think of how many were actually in female ?
11 . that 's not a .
it 's not as many as many number of women who we just in the congress , so that 's good .
but there 's a number that bigger than this is and this is this space .
last year , the new york times published the government .
you that you 're saying that you .
one of five women in the united states that they 've been to live in their lives .
i do n't think that 's the of general .
i do n't think that have to do anything .
i do n't even think that and directly to do with something , but something more complicated , and if i hear this statistics , is one of the things i think that are many of .
who are these guys ? what are they doing ?
what do you do learn ?
take your story , that 's the task of a male , to prevent the the with violence and then the , which is a woman who does n't have friends ?
so let 's take this story ?
you know , as a parent that has privilege , a daughter , as the same of you do , we find this world and these statistics in this very and we want to .
we 've got a to like " the , and we hope that help , but i 'm also asking whether is , when we 're , at the same time , active or , our , the .
the key is a means that we can do something very important , and i 'm to the .
i think we need to do our just a new idea of the - image - .
the definition of the is already changing .
you 've read , the new york of the of the and .
they 're going to the .
our sons will find a way to adapt to a new relationship , and i think we really have to show you that a is man is that his sisters , and on their side , and really the bad guys who are men
i think we should be looking for the - looking for the that we find , and looking for the search that are the to that people and to with these things and say , " i 'm on side
when i met my daughter , who 's the in " star wars , " you know what they said ?
the .
the and the .
what these common together ?
maybe it 's not just the most dress .
i think these two figures are experts .
these are the characters in the that more than others and others know to with other people to help them help them to their potential .
and they also leaders .
i like this kind of job for my daughter and i like this kind of job for my son .
i want to more tasks like this .
i want to tasks that my son said , " and " and , and he 's to a team , maybe a team that will be to help people better people , better people better people , the of
thank you .
i want to talk to you about the story of a .
i do n't know his name , but his story .
he lives in a small village in the south .
his village lies near the .
the most successful poverty of this village and the the .
and when there was nothing there was him there , he left his village , and he went into town in this case , the , the capital .
as he , there is no opportunities , no jobs , no way .
at the end , he 's a outside of the .
it may be a year , but not .
one day , he will be a by a man who him to lunch , to dinner , dinner , to the .
he 's this dynamic group to young people , and they give him a chance .
he gets a little money to buy new clothes and to home and home .
it 's going to be young .
he finally .
he starts a new life .
his life has a sense .
on a nice day in the , the , walk into the air .
this was with was the and dynamic group of young people were the to have a the with .
how could the story of a of just trying to in the world that he himself in the air ?
he had .
he had a opportunity to focus on the future , and it was the first opportunity to him to him .
it was the first thing to call him a state that we call " the .
and his story is always over again over the areas around the world .
it 's the story of the , the , the youth that are in and something than something .
young people are from the city , from their jobs , jobs , wealth , but , but people do n't have to share the most of their cities .
often , it 's the youth that are under the high .
in 2030 , three are five of five to five cities in the cities .
if we do n't young people in the growth of cities , we do n't have opportunities , they 're " , the in the violence in violence in the violence .
in my the , the , suffering , 70 percent of the young people are under unemployment .
70 percent do n't have work , do n't go to school .
they do n't really do anything .
last month , i went back after the , i went to the the , the hospital where i was born .
i remember , i heard this hospital , and i asked , what would be if i would never be here ?
what if i had to same condition of the " - forced ?
would i be ?
i 'm not sure what i want to .
the reason for this was in was in was in was actually a of a of young leaders and entrepreneurs .
i was about 90 young the leaders .
we sat together and we started a to the challenges of the city .
in the room , a young man , the .
he went to university in and there .
there was no jobs and no options .
i remember how he told me that he had a the , was frustrated and frustrated was the perfect goal , be member , and to be other .
they 're people like him .
but this story takes another different .
in the , the biggest obstacles are to from to the streets .
23 years , the have the completely , that the best is best .
and the , the opportunity and they .
he 's a .
he started to the that could n't afford to afford .
with his family and his friends , he 10 , he to be able to get his at the point in the next three years .
how do you tell this story from the other ?
what makes the difference ?
i think it 's a ability to new opportunity .
it 's the the , and i think that the can be the means to be " means . "
it 's all the people to the opportunity opportunities that they 're so desperately .
you can teach young people to be entrepreneurs .
i want to talk to you about a young guy who one of my favorite , the , the , a the .
he helped me to the of some young friends of people who are on the summit , and to the , to how to build and .
he 's actually the first the that has been working since 22 years , until before there was the , that was the the that came from the from the from the , .
when you ask someone , " when did you last time last time , you ? " the answer of many who the of the , " never " . "
so saw an opportunity .
he was a with a the with .
he was a outside of the and the , and the , which he could survive in the climate .
he started to go with flowers , and private and to the city town , and he was working on the of the first public parks in the last year .
there 's no public parks in the .
he wants to create a place where families and young people are together and he says , he can teach the beautiful things of life .
just 's the : he does n't have any because they too much water .
so the first step is to bring young people , and in this room , had the , had the very large impact on the other young people in the room .
they never had really thought about it .
they thought for a work for work or for government , but this story , but , but , a strong influence on them .
he the them to look at their place as a place of possibilities .
he 's them to be that they can be entrepreneurs , they could change the change .
at the end of the day , they had innovative solutions for some of the greatest challenges of their .
they had the solutions to local .
the inspiration of young people , and the of a is a really big , but young people need to their ideas .
they need the and to develop business and develop business .
they people with the resources that they need , they give them the support they need to make to make ideas and they will make to for growth .
for me , me more than just more than just a of a .
it 's about social .
the - sold just flowers .
i think he hope .
his design is " is , when it created , the view of people to change their city .
the who to help him to the .
he gave them the chance to the state of the the .
these young companies have a tremendous impact on their cities .
so my suggestion is , you young people to get people , and they their innovations and they 're more about and about the and " and "
thank you .
so during my childhood , i was a of my favorite , looking at the on the of , because my parents , the happiness .
but these are hard to find .
they 're from sand , barely .
but after a certain period , i had a .
i started to see , patterns , helping me .
and that was to finding a passion for the and the .
and when i started studying , i realized that see that my eyes not eyes with my eyes .
because suddenly in egypt in my beach in a car , a long miles , and the the of the to the to the size of cities .
that led me to use to use .
i had to see differently to see the past .
i want to show you how we example differently , if we use .
this is a site that was in eastern called the .
and the the appears to use , we but we 're , but it 's with color , this is suddenly of the sudden , suddenly .
what you see here is the chemical changes of landscape through the and the egyptians .
what i want to share with you today is how we used to have to find a city that the name of the the and for thousands of years .
the was the capital of the old egypt , was more than years , a called the , years ago .
the , the is in the and it 's very , because it 's a large realm of art , art , and religion .
and always knew that the of the the of the somewhere in the near the , the , the red , but in this massive of .
this area is huge -- the area is four times three miles .
at the time , the of the directly of the the , and , as its moves , changed , and towards the west , town .
so how do you find a city in a .
they 're to find to be the equivalent to find the needle in the , with eyes and the .
so , we used to the - to - map of the landscape to try to be able to see a , to see .
where the of the used to be used .
but you see , and this is very interesting , this very complex - , with the circle that we us as a possible position for the city .
so we worked with scientists to put the the what you see here .
this is like the ice in ice , just instead of the layers , change the climate change , you can , your human .
in a depth of five meters , a layer , we found a density layer of the .
so this shows that this position for you can be in five - five - , we can find more over several hundred years of carbon to the , to the to the of existence of the .
we found the -- the , the and the -- and what shows that a has a .
it might not look like much , but if you look at the the - , which were used in the in the in the , you find these rocks .
so we found a density layer of the the of on the that on the rich .
we also found evidence for a for the society , which shows that there was a very important city .
it 's not there yet , but we 're going to get back to these , soon , to a .
what more important , we to do for young who are in the , so they 're able to make great discoveries .
so i wanted to be with my - from my own , -- it was perhaps in the city of the years ago years ago .
" knowledge to share is the biggest of all the .
there 's nothing in the . "
ted was n't 1984 .
ideas , but actually , in 1984 , in a long , long , city , from top .
that you can see the .
thank you very much .
thank you .
i grew up in taiwan as a of a the , to my memories , my memories , like my mom me to the beauty , the and the form of the chinese of chinese .
i was , i was fascinated by this incredible language .
but for a , you as the great wall of china is going to be china .
i 've been wondering how i this , so everyone anyone who have interested in this complex of these complex , and also understand and .
i thought that was a new way of learning to learn .
since five , since the world , i learned every single every single every single in every single in the .
in the next 15 years , i 've learned new every new .
there 's just five minutes to have a very difficult , and very difficult , very important .
a typical - the - about a .
you need only 1,000 thousand for a simple the .
the most 200 you to 40 percent of the simple - to - to - -- enough to understand enough , to understand the and the to understand the of the .
today , i start with eight to show you how the method works .
are you ready ?
open your mouth as possible until it 's .
it 's going to be a mouth .
that person goes to a person .
" human . "
when the the for fire , a human with a poor person , if he was saying , " help ! i ! " the the takes the from the of the , but i love these idea . you take the best ones
this is a tree .
" tree .
this is a mountain .
the sun . "
the moon .
the the for " looks like a from the .
these eight are .
they are the the to create a form of .
a human .
if someone else is someone , it says , " follow . follow . "
are more , " two , " and " a .
if a human man his poor , says , " this was "
the person in mouth is like .
he 's a " , " as the in the whale .
a tree is a tree , two trees are a for a .
three are together for a " forest . "
and you put a under tree and you have a " .
put a mouth up on top of it , it means " the .
just to remember because is a tree is a .
remember , that fire ?
two black people see hot .
three fire together a lot of " . "
and put the fire under two trees , it means "
for us , the sun is the source of the .
two together . "
three are together .
when the sun and the moon , it means " it . "
in the context , it 's be for the next day .
the sun goes across the horizon .
door . a in the door says , " the .
so , put a mouth in the door , it says , " ask questions . "
the , the . is somebody there ?
this person the from the door . " , "
the left is the woman .
two women are two for women .
now , in three women , this is called " the .
we have now 30 of .
with this method , you can put the in the first eight words in the first
the next group of eight are with other words .
with a little bit of a few , you can learn a hundred of how a child - child .
when we can make these , we start them to .
for example , for a nice and , and , and the is a "
we know , japan is the land of the sun .
this is the sun with the " origin , because japan is the of china .
a sun with the origin called " the . "
a human being a to ?
a japanese . "
the are the left on the left are two mountains .
in chinese means chinese " chinese , their political their political the in the of the mountains .
today , " . "
a mouth says it says , " . "
that 's the slide that reminds me of the stage that i 'm .
