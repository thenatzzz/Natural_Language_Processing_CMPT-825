when i was in my 20s , i had my first the .
i was a and i was particularly in berkeley .
she was a woman named alex .
as a came in the first meeting , she was sitting and a , and she fell into the office in my office , her and she was me to talk about .
and when i heard that , i was .
my , had an patient to patient than patient .
and i got a woman in the people who wanted to talk about .
i 'll leave that , i thought i .
but i did n't have it .
with the stories , which alex with the back was easy to me just to head with head , we the problems .
" 30 is the new 20 " , " alex , and as far as i did , i had right .
work came later , later came later , later came later came later .
people in the in the and alex , and i had nothing time .
but soon , my , the , ask .
i was .
i said , " yeah , you know , you with your with your , you , you know , but she 's not going to marry . "
and he said , " my , " not yet , but maybe you 'll going to be the next .
and also the best time on the marriage before they 're married . "
this is what psychologists call a the .
that was the moment when i realized that 30 was not the new 20 .
yes , people later on to times as a , but did n't mean any of the to the .
and this was alex , the , the , and we got there and we sat up .
and i realized that this kind of the , a problem with real consequences , only just for alex and her , but for the , families , and all of people in the .
at this point , in the united states , 50 million people in the .
we talk about 15 percent of the population , or 100 percent if you think that nobody will never achieve the without to go through the .
now , you , when you look at your .
i want to show you some of you .
oh , yeah ! you 're all incredible .
if you work with somebody , the , loves , because of you , i 'm going to see you -- . people in the really are really important .
my , my are in the , because i think that every should have this 50 million , psychologists , and the wisdom , one of the most and most things that you can do for happiness , perhaps
this is not my opinion . that 's facts .
we know that 80 percent of the moments , to age to 35 .
that means that eight of 10 decisions , experience and experiences that live out of life , which is what you 're going to be ,
do n't want to talk about you 're over 40 .
this group is going to get good , i think .
we know that the first 10 years of a , on how much money is going to deserve .
we know that more than half americans are married or with the future partner or a relationship .
we know that brain his brain and big grow in the and to the , and what whatever you want to do to you do now time to do this .
we know that the during the of the , the , in the , and in the life and the of the women the with their peak and 35 are 35 to 35 .
so in the , you were going to be over the body and the your possibilities .
if we think about the development of a child , we know that the first five years for years and are in the brain .
it 's time the , life has a impact on the future .
but we hear about little bit about there 's something like , and our are a time for time .
but the people get people in the .
the press talking about the the of the .
scientists call the of a - .
journalists , the of people for people in people in the like " the " or " the . "
that 's true .
so as we culture , we what we have is the decade for the .
the , that things that things with a plan and little bit time .
is n't that ?
so what happens if you put someone in the head , head , and says , " you , you 've 10 years to make some of your life ?
nothing .
this person is the the and the and the the , and it does n't happen .
and so every day , people in the and or how your sons and daughters into my office and say something like , " i know , my friend does n't know good , but this relationship is not . i 'm just time .
or you say , " well , " i , i 've spent it to 30 years , it 's all good . "
but later , it sounds like , " my are almost , and i did n't have any the .
i had a better , when i had finished college . "
and then it sounds like this , " in my , like the journey . jerusalem .
all the had and fun , but then , 30 , the music was suddenly out and everybody started to .
i did n't want to be the only that i stayed , i sometimes i did my husband , because he was in my chair . "
where are people in the ?
does n't do that .
ok , that 's easy to say , but it does n't make mistakes , because it 's about much .
if , if you go to the , there 's a enormous pressure in the process , a , a city , a , and you have a two or two kids or two kids in a much more time .
and many of these things are the and like , and are just now just the and so everything in all the .
the does n't mean to the a to buy a red .
it means that you can do the career you do , do n't .
you ca n't have this kid , you ca n't want to be able to do or ca n't want to be .
too many people in the and look at themselves and myself and say me , and say , " what , what did i do ? what i just ? "
i want to change what people do in the and thinking .
this is a story that shows how it can .
it 's the story of .
and my in my when she was 25 , she had to , she had a the .
she said she 'd like to work in the arts or the , but she had n't decided to have , had in the last few years .
because was cheaper , she lived with her friend who more his .
and even though their were , were their years before they had worse .
they often in the , but then she would her and said , " your family could you do , but your friends . "
one day , very , at and almost , all the hour .
she had bought a bought , and she and she spent all morning , she had her lot of her , but then you go on the , which was called the , " in the , " in the "
she was almost the when she came up , and she said , " who 's going to be me if i have a accident ?
who will going to me if i have cancer ? "
i had to at the moment , to say , " i , " i . "
but the no music , really care about .
a needed a better life , and i knew this was her opportunity .
i had a lot of my first time to just about how the in the .
and in the next weeks and months , i was three - three - who anyone to anyone whether or , or , should hear , hear should hear .
first , i told you , she had n't have any , she would be a very successful .
and i thought , you to something that would be to .
power to something that you offer for investment , is something to what you next to be . next .
i knew no idea about chinese , no knows how the future of work , but i do n't know , the 's the .
now , time this job international job , this , this , which is try to try .
i 'm not the of the of the but that the ones that do n't count , even though they do n't even have any .
this is the .
i said to , the , but , but what do .
second , i said , the urban is .
good friends are , to get to the airport , but the , the with people who are like , to what they what they think what they think about how they 're talking and where they work .
this new , this new person , the most of the outside of outside .
new things are made " the , " friends .
it 's true : the half of the is not or not at all .
but the other half it 's not and they do n't have them .
half of jobs never have . if you 're your boss , your neighbor , your job , not a job .
this is not a . it 's spread information .
the last advice : what believed that you could n't choose the family , but the friends .
this was for her as she , but as soon as soon as soon as soon as she had to her own your own family , and she had a partner and family a family .
i told her , time , a new family , would be .
you might think that maybe it 's better , to 20 than 20 or 25 , and i agree to you .
but the , with you or , in your life , if everybody 's facebook , is not an progress .
the best time to your marriage before , you before you , and that means that the means in the love in love in love in your .
your family , means , your purpose and your and what the thing , and , and not , because it works , or anybody with the time that you just had .
so what happened to do ?
we went through her and she found the brilliant of a the who was in a in a museum .
this weak band is to get her work get a work .
and this gave her reason to her friend her she was her .
now , five years later , she 's the for museums .
she got a husband that she chose .
she loves her new and new her family and she told me a card , which was " , " the line is : " in the , you do n't get enough . "
sounds , sounds like this , it 's all simple . but that 's what i love about .
it 's so easy to help them .
in the , like the planes , who just the left and to the west .
and after the , a little bit of the difference make the difference whether you or in .
it 's true to the , or , a good conversation , a great beautiful , a can have a tremendous impact on years and even about generations .
this is an idea that all of the that knows .
it 's so simple as i said to alex .
i 've the privilege to do this day , day every day : the are not the new , so you on a , your force your own your own family .
do n't tell you about what you do n't , or not .
your now .
thank you .
in the entire , it was always our goal to connect between us and digital information , the gap between our physical world and the world on the screen where we can our imagination .
and this distance is smaller , smaller and smaller , and now it 's smaller than a millimeter that 's a , and computers are for every .
but i wondered what it would be if there was no limit at all .
i looked like what would look like .
first i 've this tool that i into the digital world , so if you focus on the screen , it to the physical character .
designers can put their ideas directly into 3d and surgeons and to the of the screen .
so this tool was built by the limit so the .
but our hands still remain outside the .
how can we do with the digital with the digital information and the whole of our hands ?
at microsoft , i 've worked with my mentor the , computer , and a little room in the keyboard in a digital .
so that a computer screen and screen to the of the fingers and fingers face , you can put his hands from the keyboard , put the and the with the hands .
and windows and a position in the room , you can easily it as you can a book from a shelf .
then you can through this book and it and it all this , on this layer of every the of .
architects can your hands both your hands and .
so in these two examples , we 're going to digital world .
but how would we take that once and the digital information ?
i 've sure you of you have already experience to read articles online and later .
but now you have to worry about it anymore .
here i have a " the . "
and this view , you get through a head of your head or your the , if the system the geometry of our body .
this idea , i started thinking about to think about the not just in the space , but it make it , so that we can make them and feel .
how would a look like this ?
in mit media lab , i with my the and my collaborators , a - .
now , in this case , this is like a tiny - in our world , which means that computers , and people can move this everywhere -- at least small little of .
effectively , we have gravity and control motion by creating magnetic , and these .
by the object digital program , we it through the constraints and space and time , and we can make human movements , and in the real world .
so example can be over by the , or the , or , and again , and in the real world .
students can use this to use complex concepts and physics and physics and unlike , or a , is a and experience that experience and it 's very powerful .
and yet , more than just what we have now in the computer , it 's to imagine how the of the world is even our everyday activity .
as you can , digital will not only us to show us , but to start with interact with our part of our physical environment , ourselves of our world .
today we have started by talking about borders , but if we remove the limit , the only is the only frontier our imagination .
thank you .
i was been to for two years to become a the , in china , china , in the 1970s .
when i was in the first grade , i wanted to get government to school , all the paid .
but my mother said , " no . " no . "
my parents wanted me to engineer how she was going to be .
after they the , they believed , they found that the only way to happiness is safe safer and good job .
it 's not important if i do n't like the job or .
but my dream was to be a chinese the .
i 'm that i 'm playing on my .
a has a very to start with the start , so i tried to try to go to the .
i wrote even at the and the and the of the .
but the adult does n't give my idea .
the adults did n't believe it was seriously to me .
only my friends had me , but they were also just as children , as i as i myself .
and i 15 years old , i knew i was too old to with training .
so my dream would never be true .
i was afraid that i could only take my rest of my life , a second .
but that 's such a .
so i had to look at my head , a different to .
no one was to me something about it ? well .
so i to .
i the my hunger to the with this book , and a " of the family of " a " woman , " the the tradition , "
[ " the " ] [ " ] " from the ] the , i got in the united states and what books did i read first ?
of course , books that are in china .
" the good earth " life from life .
it just simply as propaganda . i understood .
the bible is interesting , but weird .
but that 's a subject for another .
but the fifth thing i gave taught me a way of " , " you want your father and your mother your mother . "
" honor " i thought , " that 's so much and much better than a . "
this was my way to and to and to the relationship to my relationship to my parents .
through with a new culture , i started reading with the the .
this was a whole explosion .
for example , i did n't really take this very interesting thing , because chinese students with this one .
it never occurred to me that china is not going to be in the center of the world .
so a map tells something about personal .
the , the reading is actually nothing new .
in the academic world , it 's a the .
there 's even the like the and the .
comparison and a of a .
so i thought , if reading about the research works , why does n't work in everyday daily ?
so i began to read two books at the same time .
you can use people -- [ " franklin by the , " john " by david the , who was in the same event , or by friends with their experiences .
[ " we , " from " the " -- " life is " a life " is a the of the , -- and stories from various cultures , like joseph the , " joseph " ] the and had to three
in were , the , the political events , political and nature .
in the they were all nature : , and social -- interesting .
if you make a , it fun to read the the in two languages .
[ " the " for " for " the " the of the water -- the the of the the " by alan the , instead of me in the translation , i figured out how much i can .
i 'm to that , " happiness " happiness " happiness " happiness "
" in " means " new mother . "
books for me like an magical , and i 've i to one connection to the people and the present .
i know that i never feel more or i 'm feel .
a dream is really nothing to compared what many other have .
i came to the belief that it 's not the only purpose of a single - true .
his purpose is to get us to where dreams , where our passion and our happiness is .
even a dream can be this purpose .
because of i am here today , i 'm happy , happy with a with a purpose in life and with a lot of time .
you 're always be with .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
when i was eight years old , a new girl in the class , and she was like amazing as girls to be .
she had the hair and a little the , was good in and .
i was in the , i until i until a the plan .
so i stayed a little bit longer school , a lot of longer , and i was in the hidden .
when the air was , i came into , i took into the classroom , i took the the of the the .
and then i did .
i the the notes of my the , just , just some few .
all of the .
when i wanted to make this book , i noticed to me that some of my other had to be pretty good .
so i in the all of all the , without .
i gave all of all , and i myself because i was because i was also all the time .
i 'm still more about my behavior .
i do n't understand where the thought came .
i do n't understand why i 'm so good at that .
i felt really good .
i do n't even know why i never to it .
it was so obvious .
i was never caught .
but most of me , why is it so that this little girl was so good in the ?
i 'm not happy .
she 's so , .
we know that babies are suffer .
similarly as primates . the are inherently from nature .
we know that the of the is in among in the united states .
but i never a study that i could their or their or their .
so to do that , we need to the literature , because the novel is the lab in the in all their forms .
is it a to say that if we do n't have any of , we have no literature ?
so no the , no "
no the king , no " from " night . "
no shakespeare .
and , as the of the , we , " and " and " the great " , " the , " the , " the . "
no , no , no the , i know that 's in to say that has the answer , but in the , it actually really .
this year , we this to the , and the the on the search for the long time , and his analysis of the sexual and the of the , my thing that we can hope .
think about think , think about feelings . right ?
we think about the little boy to try to sleep .
we think thinking about a piece of cake , in the .
we forget how the his vision was .
we forget how he 's .
these are books are like the as the .
i do n't know how the is , but let 's say , 's .
let 's look at the why the novel and the that the and so well .
is it so obvious that , to -- , such a basis for a story ?
i do n't know . i think it 's just hard to the , because think what happens when we 're .
when we 're a , we tell ourselves a story .
tell us stories about the lives of other people and make them feel that it 's bad , because they 're so bad that it 's bad .
as an artist of the , and the audience we know , which detail , to the into the . right ?
the 's hard to all us to , and with .
in the first band , " in world , one of the great , thinks about his care and , so they 're , and he will " wait , " i 'm going
everything you give me and me joy , might be happy to joy , even in this moment . "
this is the story that he tells , and from there , to the , that he 's every new he discovered at his , his in his the .
we 've got to admit that the and the are .
and friends had have to leave the country if they want to with him .
but you do n't need to take a to realize that it hard work . right ?
it 's a .
it 's a the feeling that needs to be .
what does the ?
it 's like information .
i like the details .
it 's like the hair and little .
i want like to photos .
so that 's why it 's so successful .
basically , the language of science and science .
when these the , suddenly out the door , and the of his the , his , he this behavior .
he says , " you think you 'll be that 's a , but it 's not nothing to see a text , or a text . "
he says , " there 's scientific worth . "
what 's trying to show is that is to make us look at , but in her core , and for the truth , the truth , and the , : the , the better .
so , that 's for the to the wisdom .
he says , " a woman that we need to suffer us , us a greater and more than a man who 's interested . "
he tells us about that we should look at women ?
no . i think he 's to say that he 's us to tell us about ourselves .
is there another different that we us in this particular way ?
how do we feel our and our and ?
we do n't feel different with these kinds of sound ?
freud , later , write about this .
one day was a by a very young man who was by the thought of his wife , his wife .
and freud says , this man is kind of strange , because he does n't even know what his wife does .
because she 's innocent , and everybody knows that .
the poor creature is lower under .
instead , he looking for his wife , no it ,
she too or she with a man ?
[ freud ] says that the man is to the of the of his wife .
the novel is very good at this point .
it 's very good how much hard - us , but not .
because the more we are , the more we to .
so i think that 's not that way to do is not to do or illegal things .
i 'm to be very .
and i think about myself about eight years , but i think also the story i 've in the news .
a woman from michigan was written , because she was from a himself by a the , the news for himself
a year for a year .
she tried to get her new friend of her shoes into the shoes , and i stopped when i heard , i was with .
because ... let 's be honest .
what does it mean , if creativity , creativity , creativity ?
this is something from a novel .
this is something from a novel of the .
the is one of my favorite .
she 's the most the and the woman of american .
from her , " the " in the " the the mr. the , " it books to how to you , and we 're once in the realm of the , in the in between the and what could be --
take a the , your character .
first , want to be tom , and have what they have , and it 's what they had once , and they are like by the , and he calls to their name , he name her , her the .
this is a method .
but what do we do ? we ca n't do it as tom .
i ca n't give the world , even though i 'd like to do it for some days .
it 's a shame , because we live in a period .
we live in a live - era . time .
we are all good social media that are currency about , right ?
do we show the ? i 'm not sure .
let 's do what do , if you 're not sure if you 're in a of a .
let 's go back to the street and ask questions to the .
think about think about think about the , as a professor , this great .
but i liked always [ ] , the boss of the with the face of a rat , the the needs , needs , needs , but it to him .
that 's me familiar .
so , needs his help , put him and the stories of stories .
but as she started to start starts to start something , and eventually , " the six , " as the , and with all his solution , the to and say , " we 're not the on them , mr. the .
we 're proud . them . "
and he 's that no at the the , would n't be the to the shake .
this is one of the few times that we see the in his stories , and i 'm these little very , very , but also 's a .
it seems like this is not an emotional , but a problem .
in a moment , a moment is a on a different like .
and the next moment , they 're on a wavelength .
suddenly it 's to it , this , he has to him .
is it really easy ?
what if really was a really problem , if it was just about how we deal with the other in ?
maybe we would n't be to be the same .
we could we could we could .
but i like the .
while we 're waiting for , we still the literature as a .
literature alone , the .
literature alone , it can , .
and who 's all the : the good news , the the tom , the crazy the , the .
we 're in society .
thank you .
i was about 10 years old , and on a the - old with my father in a the , a the in the northern of the new york .
it was a great day .
the forest .
the sun would look at the petals like glass , and if no have been , would have almost you that we were the first people who had through this forest .
we came to our .
i saw the little hut on a cliff and across a the , beautiful , as something called horrible .
behind the roof , a one , four , the , the and a old the .
i was amazed , i was angry and confused .
the were to were to , what had -- who were they , would they would to them ?
the question was asked me and i asked them to me , : i asked them .
who we to us ?
how do you also it or where it " us , who are behind us behind us ?
who 's behind us in rio or in paris or in london ?
here in new york the , the the of every day of day was tons and 2000 tons .
i wanted to them -- individuals .
i wanted to understand who make the job .
how is it to wear a uniform and wear ?
so i started a with them .
i went to the , the and went to and in the city , and i learned a lot of , but i was still a .
i had to go to deeper .
so i took a job as a the .
i was not just the same . i was the .
and i was the mechanical the and the snow .
it was a wonderful privilege and an exciting experience .
everybody asks after the .
it 's there , but not as you think , and days , it 's really bad , you 're pretty quickly .
and you , you , you just hard to do .
i know people who were this number of years , whose body , still , that weight her body , tons of every week .
then there 's the danger .
after the statistics of the , the in the under the 10 of the country in the country , and i learned why .
you 're all the entire day , all over the , all over .
everybody wants to and often do n't have to be .
this is really bad for workers .
and the garbage itself is full of the that the from the the and terrible .
i learned also about the the of the .
if you look from the the and from the back of the city , a city , you can see that the is like a itself .
he does n't stop to .
it 's also like a kind of or .
it 's always to be in motion .
and then 's the stigma .
you put the uniform and it 's , until somebody -- whatever -- whatever -- because you 're going to take the traffic or your a , or you can a coffee , and you and you and say , and you do n't have
i think this particular because i believe that the staff of the most important city on the streets of city . that 's three reasons .
they 're the of the health .
if you do n't survive the waste , every day efficient and effectively , he would take out of the the and the and the would continue to us .
diseases that 've been decades and decades , and we would spread and us .
the economy takes it .
if we do n't take the old , we do n't have place for the new , the motors the of the economy is to , when the is .
i do n't not know the capitalism , i 'm just going on the .
and then 's what i our , .
and i 'm just by just how fast we 're now today .
we do n't care about why our , our or our , or we can , or , or .
we take them , throw away , forget , because we know that people are on the other side that are care about .
so i want to share today some ways today , how to think about how to think about the and them into this conversation , how you create a city that are sustainable and .
and work , i think , is kind of the .
you see the streets every day , regularly .
they carry in many cities .
you know when you expect to .
and your work do our .
they 're like a .
the that you , us , imagine before us before our , the , and has to be more and to any price .
after days after september , i took the of a the on the street , and my son and ran the and there was a man who his , he every .
and i tried to him to work -- day , day days , but i started to cry .
and he looked at me and just and said , " everything 's fine . "
" everything 's fine . "
first later , i started to learn my research and the husband .
his name is the , and we worked together , we eventually got good friends .
i wanted to believe that the had right .
everything is good .
but in our efforts , change the way we on this planet as we have to do , the , cost , including the very cost of work .
and we must be informed to people who do to do this work , how we think about how we systems about , which is a of the last 40 years and countries and to us to a species of waste that can be transformed by production
the , we think about when we talk about power , three percent of the national .
it 's a remarkable statistic .
in your daily , in your lifetime , if you see next to see somebody whose job is to make them , take a moment time you 're .
take a moment to get to .
hello , what goes ?
this is not enough .
hello , what goes ?
my name is the , and i 'm not drunk , but the doctor in my birth .
he 's got six directions , and i me little , the air .
so i what i 'm doing is what i means i 'm going to do all the time .
look .
it 's a . i 'm a of , and .
not is n't genetically .
it 's not a the . you ca n't get it .
nobody has the of my mother , and i did n't get it because my parents are the first , what they are .
you get through accidents , like the one of my birth .
i have to warn you . i 'm not a source of inspiration , and i do n't want anybody to me to me because you all have to in a point in your life .
and just comes to .
it 's just a christmas in the . and you see the beautiful circles looking for a and what you see ?
the .
and you thinks , " why ca n't i be a little bit ? "
i have to say you , i 'm 99 problems , and only is one of them .
if there was a of , i a .
i 'm a the , and i live in new jersey .
now if you do n't better , you , i do n't know .
the park in new jersey my hometown .
i love the fact that my and my have the same .
and , i love the fact that i could walk from my home new york city if i wanted to .
many people do n't run with hot , but my parents do n't to "
this was my father 's " yes , you can . can . "
so if my three older sisters , i with .
if my three older sisters down to school , my parents to , so i could go , and if we were not all of , all of the mother 's mother 's mother .
my father taught me to walk when i was five , by my his feet on his feet , just the .
another of his was to a of my front of my nose , so i 'm going to get them .
my was very strong , and as -- yeah , and the first day in the kindergarten , i was like a who had a to a .
there was only six only in my city , and all my family were all my family .
today we have 20 in the city , and they 're still all my family .
i think no one has ever noticed that we do n't have a .
this was before 9/11 before and before it took it for a , " i hate to use as a .
the people i had with up with no , no problem with my faith .
but they were very worried that i could possibly to maybe .
and i explained to you that i had to live three entire three months three , from the to the to a to a .
i have the .
yes , on the . totally crazy .
my parents could n't afford to afford , so they sent me to the .
i learned how to make on to , so i can i can walk on .
and i 'm from the , where it really important to be , so when my own , then i also .
and if my friends had my friends on the coast of the , i do n't .
i spent my summer in a summer because my parents had afraid that we if we had n't get every single summer , day , day , will be like .
the the often that my dad wanted to me , so i used to milk of the , and i was going to the dead , and i know how the water in the eyes and i thought , " it works ! it
but we found a , we found : .
i have to say it 's really boring , but before i did , i was a - old , who ca n't even stand .
now i can stand on head .
my parents always me that i would be able to be that not was not impossible , and my dream was to be at the general . "
because of the , of , i had a great scholarship on the university , who had the state , because i 'm every minority of .
i was kind of the the of the the .
all loved me .
i do n't like all of the to so much , in all my all , getting in all of their .
every time i a scene from " the , my teachers .
but i never got a role .
so in my , the , piece of " dance , dance ,
a piece of a girl with a .
i was a girl with a .
so i everywhere , " finally , i have a !
i have a !
finally !
thank god , thank you , i 'm free ! "
i did n't have the role .
the brown had got the role .
i was to the of the , i the , when someone had my cat , and she asked why she said me , she said , " i , i n't want to do the .
i said , " sorry , but if i ca n't , if i ca n't , the character can do . "
i was born to this , and she gave them a without a .
college life .
hollywood is known to physically healthy .
after i went back to my first part was a the in a the .
my dream was true .
and i knew that i was soon to say "
but instead , i had a the that was just the only , and realized that the did n't have a , .
they just perfect people .
but exceptions , the you the .
i grew up with the , the and the , and all of these women had a common : they were the .
so i became up .
my first job was to , new york city new york city , and i 'm never going to the face of the first ever , forget , was that to be in the street to new york with a the of a the
i am in america , the united states , i 've also been the on the arabic , the and the .
some people say , i 'm the first - in the arab world .
i do n't want to ask the first , but i know that you 've never heard about the bad little bit that women are not , and they 're us to .
2003 , my brother from a mother and father , dean , and i was to new york new american that already to be .
our goal was to the negative image of americans from to change and to the , that , and , and not .
the of was much more than the challenge , the against the of .
my great breakthrough was in 2010 .
i was been to the in " the "
i was like to the the river , she 'd me into a studio and i sat on a chair .
so i looked at the the , and said , " i , i can i can get another other chair ? "
and she looked at me at me and she said , " five , four , three , two ... "
and we were live ! live !
so i had to make the table on the table , so i did n't get the from the screen , and when the interview was finished , i was me .
there was my chance , and i had her , and i knew that i never back .
but mr. the invited me , but he made me a to an the and my chair .
at work with keith , i 've learned , : all people are internet .
people say , kids are , but as a child or adults , or never been me .
in the world wide web , i 'm with my of the .
when i look at online , i see like , " the , why this ? "
" the , is the the ? "
and my favorite : " the .
did you have ?
we should be for them . "
even , my disability into the the : the , the , the , the .
a disability is as visible as it 's like .
if a ca n't play , ca n't play .
the are the biggest -- yes . it 's a worth value .
people are the largest minority in the world , and we are the most in the .
the doctors said , i never walk , but i 'm sitting here .
but i would be independent social media , i would n't be here .
i hope that we can take together a picture of in the media and the .
maybe there 's no way to be no at least no more difficult if there were more positive .
or maybe not .
maybe it 's still a village to a good .
my journey has led me to a very special places .
i put on the red next red the and the the .
i was in a film with adam the and with my , which is amazing by .
i 'm as a the with the the " the " around the world .
i was a huge the - in new national center in 2008 .
i 've " the 's a , who 's trying to the person who will give to the to give you a chance of my parents .
but the one that the most -- before -- this -- the most , when i first , the man , how the a and how a bee , and the bee , and the way as i do , .
this was the only time ever to me , and i was to talk to this talk .
now , god your soul , your dad , dad , my name is the , " if i can , you can . "
there was a time we 're big .
on the 21st , july , the from the apollo and , and the , and the was the to the ocean of the .
armstrong and the were alone , but their presence on the top of the , was the peak of a the , the .
the was the largest in the history of the united states of america .
to the moon , nasa , about billion dollars worth of worth , four percent of the .
apollo created for 400,000 people and the the collaboration of 20,000 companies , universities and universities .
people died , including the of the apollo .
but until the end of the end , 24 people to the moon .
from the 12 that 's his surface , after death , the last year , now the oldest .
why did they do ?
they did n't go back to the , the old , and something , which all the 24 later -- a new sense of our home is small and fragile .
why did they go ? the , they went because president had wanted to show the to his . had better .
but the on words on the university of the , a .
now , was n't just a victory of the across the east during the cold war .
at the time , this was a feeling of the of technology .
it was to the moon because it was something great .
the the - a - a - a - class series of technological .
from the first half of the 20th century , the and the and the , and a vaccine against a .
and in the middle of the century , polio and eradicated .
technology seemed to something that what 's called the a " the . "
for most of the human history , we could n't even faster a horse or a boat , a year , but the apollo 10 pounds about 10 kilometers per hour .
since 1970 , there were no human beings on moon .
no one has ever faster than the of apollo , and the optimism is about the power of the technology is , because the big problems we had to technology , to clean , or the world the world , seem to seem
i remember as a the , as i as a the .
and the of the apollo 17 , and my mother me not to very the in the the .
i had a idea that this was the last final , but i was able to make sure it was still in my life on mars .
the the , something with our ability to deal with big problems with technology , become a become a .
you hear it everywhere .
we 've heard it in the last two days .
it 's a that if us had a hard and ourselves themselves with , with things like and social media and or social media , or algorithms , the .
it 's nothing wrong with most of these things .
they have our lives and .
but they do n't solve the big problems of humanity .
what happened ?
there 's a explanation from silicon valley where you have that in recently , less than any employees , in years , intel , apple , apple and the .
in silicon valley , you are used to be in particular , the special , which are the company .
silicon valley says that of have moved to , to help ideas , and , and even problems .
but this explanation is not good enough .
it explains mainly with silicon .
even their the times , small little , tiny , a 10 years within 10 years .
investors had always been to invest in technologies like energy , which is a the and development , and never , never been able to solve the problems of no problems .
no , the reasons why we ca n't solve a problem , complicated and complicated .
sometimes we do n't consciously to , not to the big .
we could fly to mars if we want .
nasa has even a plan .
but to go to a political decision , public , and it 's going to happen , and it will never going to happen .
we 're not going to fly to mars because everyone thinks that there are be done on earth 's stuff that needs to be done .
another time we can not solve the big problems because our political systems are fail .
today , less than two percent of the earth 's earth , from sources , solar wind , wind , less than two percent , and the reason is .
coal and gas are cheaper than solar wind and wind and cheaper is cheaper than cheaper .
we all want to alternative that can keep the , but no exist .
now it 's that , and all of all the same opinion , the national of international and international development , mainly , is a economic in development and development and a price for carbon .
but in the current political climate , there is no hope that the u.s. of the united states or the international , or the international the .
sometimes are more complex problems that technically , but not so .
it 's been believed that the is the .
but 30 years research , we taught that political impact on the impact .
technologies can things like systems or systems like systems and , and it 's going to be famine , as long as there are .
eventually , sometimes we are sometimes to because solutions because we do n't understand properly .
president , the was told the war , but you discovered that there were many of cancer , which most of the have been therapy , and only the last 10 years , the therapies is actually to be in .
difficult problems are difficult .
it 's not true that we ca n't solve great problems with technology .
we , we have to have to do , but to have these four elements , the politicians are : politicians and politicians must be to solve , problem ; we need to solve the solution ; it needs to be a problem ; we have to understand
the that led to a kind of metaphor for the ability to solve , to solve big problems ,
but this is a model that 's not going to happen in the future .
it 's not the year - year .
there 's no battle struggle like the cold war , no politicians like john 's , who 's all and to an power , and no the and the do n't like the like the .
but in the , it was just to fly to fly moon .
he was only three days .
and it 's really that whether it 's really serious problem .
we are ourselves and the solutions of the future will be to be .
god , it does n't be us to challenges .
thank you .
i want to you to close your eyes .
imagine you 're going to your .
look at the door , their color and the material made out of them .
now , you a group of the - on - grade on their front .
it 's a the - , and you come up and you and your .
you to think that .
they 're up , and directly to .
and then they all directly into your .
bicycles , all the and the , and the in the .
now , the of your , or what 's on the side of your brain , and , how to the in the room .
the light seems to the .
it 's you from your desk 's a horse .
one horse .
you can almost like , his gets your nose .
you the the the that it into the mouth .
go over to over , over in your living .
here you want to be your .
her clothes just the , she , " she had always touched a , while she 's on your the .
now , i 'm going to look at your kitchen .
the floor was replaced by a yellow the , and it 's made out of the , the the , the the , " and the " from " from the " , " , hand , hand .
okay . now , open - eyes .
i want to tell you about a very competition , every year in new york city new york city .
it 's called " the . "
a few years ago , i wanted to talk about this the as a the , and the the , the of the the .
it was a bunch of new and some few of , and very and .
they 're looking for hundreds of numbers .
and the of and the of all of
and it whole thing just in minutes .
they were about who the of a of a the in the .
this is crazy .
these have to have skills .
i started to talk to some of them .
this is ed , a guy who was from england , and there 's one of the the .
and i asked him , " ed , when did you do you have this particular theory ? "
and ed said , " i 'm not a the .
i just had a average memory .
everyone who 's here , will tell you that she has just a .
we all , techniques , it , to help these incredible the , which is the two years ago , the same techniques that used to his and , and the to build books to books
and i thought , " wow , how is i never heard of it ? "
we stood outside the and , and this wonderful , brilliant , brilliant , and funny the english says , me , " josh , you 're a american journalist .
you know , " you ? "
i said , " what ? what ? why ? "
" i 'd like to talk to the how to order to order a order of a the - in - .
it would be the world prove that everybody can be . "
i told him , " i 'm not , but i but i could teach me teach .
i mean , you have to start somewhere , right ? "
and that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me .
i 've spent a lot of the next year , i spent not just to my memory , but also to it and understand it understand how it works , and it can not be and what could be .
i have a lot of really interesting people .
this is , for example , this is , for example , example .
it 's suffering under the and probably the worst memory of the world .
his memory is so bad that he 's n't even be his the . what 's amazing .
although though it was so tragic , he in it , how much our memory our us to who we are .
on the other side of the spectrum , i learned to the side .
i 'm familiar with .
he was the most beautiful in the movie film in the film "
we spent a afternoon to in public in lake city .
and i came back to a whole of over the memory , two years ago , and in the in the in the , and later in the .
and i had a whole bunch of interesting things .
especially , especially me that there was time to the to , not nearly as much as today .
there was a time to people in their memory , it was the .
over the last few decades , we 've a series of technologies -- from the to the the , the , the computer , the computer , the smartphone -- it 's always easier to our , to the our human ability
these technologies have our to make our modern world , but at the same time .
they 've changed us and i would argue that they 've also changed us .
without the , seems sometimes it seems like we .
one of the last places that earth , you still find people who still are passionate , and , and that is unique .
in fact , it 's not unique , there are like this around the world .
and this has me in the , i wanted to know how these guys do this .
a few years ago , a university at university london a group of the .
they wanted to know : is the structure or anatomy of brains differently than the rest of us ?
the answer was : no .
are you smarter than we ?
she gave them a the , and the answer was , was n't really .
there was a interesting and interesting between the brain and a the brain and a with the that was compared to it .
if you put them in a and your brain , as you can imagine , faces and images pictures of you , you can see that the regions of regions of the than the rest of us .
it seems like they 're using the part of your device using it and use it .
why ? and we learn from learn something ?
the to the memory , a kind of a - , every year , every year , to with a new technology to the more of and more rest of the rest .
this is my friend ben the , the .
on the front of him , 36 , he , he the himself within a an hour that he invented and as a single , the .
it 's a similar technology around the of 140 of the , in an hour in an hour .
yes . yes . yes .
and even though it 's a kind of techniques , things like this in these , but all of these techniques on the concept that the psychologists called the .
this is so much about this concept , this concept , . it 's like follows : if i 'm two people to the same , and tell you , " the , " that you 've a person called the west . "
this is his name .
and i say , " well , " there 's a person who 's a . "
now , i to you back to a moment now , and say , " you know the word i 've ever met you before you before ?
you know what you 've been done ? "
the person who person the person who may be the , reminds , remember , more likely to remember the person who person the person who person the person .
same word , things , things , ; it 's weird .
what 's going on ?
well , the name of the means is nothing .
he 's absolutely all of all the the that in your head .
but the profession of the , we know we know .
so white wear white .
so , have a on their hands .
so smell good when they come home .
we may even know even a .
and when we hear the word first , we 've got this whole word with the word and allow it that later that it later .
the secret what happens to the , and the secret of to be able to realize better , to find the names of the into the , -- a information that has no sense in meaning in meaning in ways meaning in relation
one of the most techniques can 500 two 500 years back to the .
she was known as the known .
the story of his story : it was a poet called the who a the .
he was been to because of the , because , when you were really a really big , you , n't get a the , but a poet .
he 's his poem from the memory and the room , and the moment , the moment , the up behind me and all the .
not only not all dead , your body are to the the .
nobody one can tell anyone who was nobody , nobody knows where who has .
the body can not properly .
it 's a tragedy after the other .
the 's outside , the only way of this , he 's his eyes and suddenly he can see his front eye , where i where i .
and so he takes the of hand , and it causes the .
now , this moment , we something that we all know that we do n't know how much we , we can we a very good and memory .
i would like to ask you to first the first 10 words of history , so that you could find hard .
but i bet if i ask you to remember , who remember who 's sitting on a moment - horse in your horse , your , then you might have the .
the idea of the is to create a building - eye - and it with the images of things -- the the , the , the , the , the , of the as it 's to memory .
this is a that wrote over 2,000 years old , about the memory .
so how does it work ?
you 're invited to you to talk about ted talk , and you keep it out of the , as it would be done , he 'd been to years ago .
you 're like to imagine you imagine your .
imagine a secret crazy and crazy story with pictures of , to remind you that you first about this about crazy talks , about emotional .
and then you put your house and you hit the back on the back of mr. .
and that would remind you to start your friend ed .
and if you look at , you to a that you to tell .
you put into your kitchen , and the fourth thing you to talk about this was journey to you for a year , and you 've got friends you to remember you remember . remember .
so , this research was found out of their -- not word , word , " to be , topic .
the english term " the , " which is the theme of coming from the greek word "
these are some of those people when people about and in terms of
the " first , " in first place . "
i was just that it was just fascinating and i 'm still and i 'm
some of the - .
i wanted to write something about this the of the .
but there was a problem .
the problem that the are the - are - are .
it 's like a group of people who sit sitting and write a test .
it 's already exciting when someone 's the .
i 'm journalist i need something to do something about it .
i know that the things in the people in the people , but i do n't have access to it .
so if i wanted to tell this story , i had to able to do it .
and so i began to get every morning every 20 minutes 20 minutes before i started with my newspaper , to something .
maybe a poem or maybe a poem or a poem or maybe a poem or maybe a poem .
the name from a old the that i bought on the the .
i had to make it was much fun .
i could never imagine .
it has fun because it 's not about to memory .
you 're always better , and these crazy , hopefully , images , or to , or ,
i 'm at it .
here i am with my the .
a few of and a the that were up to two small year , because the greatest enemy is the enemy .
i went to the same i had a year earlier , i had a year earlier , year .
and i 'm to do this , just as an experiment .
it could be a nice - for my .
the problem was that the experiment did n't like .
i won the , which , which really should n't have should happen .
it was nice to and , but that was n't what i wanted to do .
these are just tricks .
tricks the work because they work on some simple ideas about the the of our solar system .
you do n't have to build a - or - or - to - to - to - to - to - how to can to the .
we often talk about people with memory , as if it 's a special , but it 's not true .
good are the .
we 're going to look better if we look .
we remember we 're getting .
we remember , if we have the possibility to figure out why information and experience are to us why they have meaning and when we can them into something that we can sense of our sense of the , and if we can the "
the the , these the , they all .
in fact , it 's not real .
they work working because they work us .
they 're us to be and , and in a way we 're not usually .
but it 's not a .
that 's how things happens to memory .
one thing i want to do with you is something i 'm through by the , the man not n't be remembered to his life , learned , our lives are the of our memories .
how much are we willing to make our lives , that we our , or our human to us to us , how much are we , because we are so lazy that we do n't want to be the and ?
i learned that memory , in any of us , has incredible tremendous .
if we want to live a life , we have to be the person who do n't remember .
thank you .
at the age of 27 , i went to a job in the the , and a job .
in public schools in new york i was to for the .
as every teacher i did , i tests and .
i was homework .
as the work , i , i , i .
and the was n't the only difference between the best and worst students .
and the , some of my students were not the .
some of my kids do n't get special good .
that 's me .
in the same , in , is difficult is : numbers , the , a area of a .
but no way n't these concepts , i found that convinced that all my students all students all the students , they could do hard and hard enough .
and after some years , i came to the conclusion , i had to a lot of understanding for students and learning from a perspective of motivation , from a psychological perspective .
what we do is we can measure the is , but what if in school and life , much more than the ability to learn and learn ?
so i left the classroom , and a to .
i started to kids and adults in all kinds of all , and i wondered who is successful and why ?
my , and i went to west .
we were trying to what would be the and not .
we went to national and , and the to what would be would be .
we studied the that worked in very tough very , and asked them to teachers the of the , and they were able to improve their students .
we were partnerships with , and , who were to their , and they could find their the .
and who would make the money .
so all these different things that we an individual as an opportunity .
it was n't social intelligence .
it was n't good , physical , and it was n't .
it was brilliant .
and is and for very long term .
it is the .
and is when you remember a , not just for a week , a month , but for a , really hard to plan . plan .
it 's is like a marathon , not a .
i started in school in chicago .
i asked to students , the of the , and then they waited to a year to see who was made up .
it showed that kids with kids are even more likely to meet , even if i can show some things properties things like , tests , even as they did in school .
so , is not only not in and , but also in school , especially for children .
the issue about this topic is that we know , little bit about the science as little how it .
every day , ask me parents and teachers teacher , " how do we study kids ? "
how did i teach to a ?
how do i do it for ? "
the answer response : i do n't know .
what i know is that you do n't know to be to do .
our data show us that a lot of people do n't simply to be .
in fact , we do n't necessarily our mental , but even the talent .
so far as the best idea i 've been to from the of the , is called the the - attitude .
this idea was to stanford by the and the belief that the ability to learn to learn not to change their change .
dr. the , shown that kids when kids read about the brain and learn how to change and how to change and how much , and much more likely to do , because it 's not a belief state .
this posture is a great idea for the .
but we need more .
i 'd like to finish my finish , we 've already so far .
this is the work that we 're .
we need to best our best ideas and .
we have to do whether we succeeded , we need to be willing to have to learn lessons and learn from .
in other words , we need to kids .
thank you .
in the middle of my work is to be connected to our and part of the environment , architecture from the natural , local conditions and traditions .
today , i 'm like example , example , projects .
both of projects are in , and in ethiopia and one in tunisia .
they also have common that the different of different perspectives are a part of the brain .
the first example started to a invitation , a the - in a in - capital .
this is the kind of building that we us , my team and me , as an example of what we should be shown .
first , i thought i wanted to .
after we saw some of these buildings -- there 's lots of the city -- we that they have three of .
first , these are these buildings , they very large very large , people do n't afford to buy things .
second , need to do is much energy because surfaces are glass , which is inside , and then you need a lot of the .
in a city , not should n't happen to , because they 've pretty quite weather that 's going to 25 to 25 .
and thirdly , their nothing and with to do with ethiopia and ethiopia .
this is a place a place called a rich culture and tradition .
and also , i was really first to the first really of the old the with the old market with this the - , where thousands of people go and to , day , day .
it has also this idea of space that uses the uses to create activity .
so i thought , this is exactly what i really want to design , not a .
but the question was , how we could build a building , building with these principles .
the next challenge came to we did , because it 's in a town of town , where most of the buildings you were sitting on the picture .
it 's between two that have across a hundreds of meters .
first we created a connection between these two , and all the of the building .
this is a - the , that creates a in the building that is itself through its own shape and sun and rain .
and to take this , we this idea of a little with a little that every in every , because of the shape of the change , change .
i also think , how do we like to building the buildings ? how do we use the ?
i really wanted to find a solution to the local .
i started thinking about think like a out of concrete in the that which the air , and the light , but in the form .
and then i this these beautiful buttons in the the .
they have the properties of a geometry , and that helped me to the entire .
we 're building this little , the that air and light into a lot of buildings .
and this is going through these little , little bits , which the light from the to building the building at the building .
it was n't simply the to with this ideas , because they thought , " this is not a not - , - did n't have . "
but then we realized that this idea is the much more powerful than the idea of a , because they can do more .
and the concept of the was a much , not a lot of the material compared , but it because we had n't need to clean conditioning .
so we created some the we used to use this project .
the first time was to think about how to make the building buildings , in a city that almost every day .
we created a contribution called by on the roof .
and under this these , we this as a new public space with space and that we could make this .
these the on the roof , the water to the into the .
hopefully , at the beginning of the next year , because we have the to five 5 .
the second example is a the - 2000 - in and in .
so to order to project a project , the project i 've ever designed , i had to understand the city of really , but also the environment , the tradition and the culture .
and as this analysis , i , i 'm particularly on the , the old - old structure that was from by a wall , 12 , and by nearly was connected to the .
when i was to the first , first step to build the existing streets to create the first 12 , with size of and like the in and in other cities with these the cities .
so , we some points in the at the concept of this , and they leave with straight , and the changed the pattern .
the final step was about the cell , the little cell of the project , like the , as a part of the the .
what would the best in a climate - for a ?
this is the , because the between the two the that created , and is an natural .
so we a pattern about the that the most that most of the most are perfectly in this direction .
and that 's the result , it 's almost like a combination of a european and arab .
there are the blocks with the and in the , these are all sorts of things .
it also the local that density higher density to the upper , and a density in a .
it also the concept of the .
and the volume has this shape form , which has three different parts , and also in into very dense light into the , there are three different institutions , like a the and a kindergarten and a of the that are activity into
the roof , my - in this project , gives the community 's almost the space , which is going to build the building .
there can all neighbors and things and make things like a the - like the morning , from a building to another building .
these two examples have a common approach to the .
they 're in emerging , where you can see the cities literally .
in cities , changes the architecture of architecture in the and future life people local communities and as buildings .
and that reason , i think it 's important to architecture , but solutions , the solutions that the relationship the relationship between the community and the environment and the to nature and connecting .
thank you .
i want to talk about trust , and i want to talk to you about the magic opinions .
they 're so ubiquitous to they used to become the .
and that 's what i think about three .
first of all : is in , many .
then we need to trust more confidence .
and a task : we should to rebuild the confidence .
i believe that the , the goal and the challenge is to wrong false wrong .
i want to give you a different story about a claim , a goal and a better approach to the right thing .
first of all : why do people think that is more ?
and if i really talk to my talk , i know , i do n't know the answer .
maybe it has some in some or , or in some other .
i 'm not going to be .
but i can look at the surveys of the that the are the source to believe that it 's a .
look at a look at a period of a , is not a lot of to .
and will be people who people who were 20 years ago , mainly and , and still .
and the people who taught 20 years ago , it 's still very , very , very , : , nurses .
we 're other people between the , and the almost in the middle .
but is that a good proof ?
the - -- .
what could you be able to do ?
so you look at the general mindset of people when you 're asking certain questions .
trust politicians ? trust ?
now , if you asked somebody asked , do you trust ?
trust it ?
trust it ?
and then would you 'd probably ask , " well , " ? "
and that would be a reaction .
and if you understand the answer to you , you might say , " i 'm going to you some of you , but not . "
totally rational .
in short , we 're trying to live in our short lives , we 're in different ways .
we do n't think of that we every or a in a or an inner - .
so i could say about that , i had a given - known , first grade , i would n't want to do it .
i know , know that i do n't know that it 's not good at car .
i that my friend a conversation on running , but perhaps not that she was a secret .
simple .
so know how we know from our everyday ways , how different can look , why do we know this knowledge when we think about trust ?
the situation are doing very well about the actual system , because they ignore the sense of the , that you 're in .
second , we get to the goal .
the goal is to trust more .
honestly , i think i think the stupid .
i would n't going to be that .
i would try to trust the more of the , but not n't .
i 'm not allowed to do it to trust .
and those who have to put their savings into the hands of a certain , who , like the , " the , " he " he " , " i think i think , " well , much more .
" trust is not a real goal in this life .
trust and be and be should be the goal .
and then you say , yes , okay , what is most important is not trust , but it 's .
the people from humans .
and to do that , we need to look at three things .
are you ? are you honest ? are you ?
if we can a person in the topics , and , and we can find , we have a good reason to trust , they 're .
but the person , probably not , .
some of my friends are friends and i would n't want to letter them letter , because they are the .
i have friends who are very much in their own , but these are .
and i 'm very happy about that i do n't have many friends that are the and , but are .
if you have , i did n't even have any .
but after that , we only , trust .
trust is the response .
the we have to do that , of course , that 's hard .
over the past decades , we 've tried to design , in all sorts of treatments and experts and experts and that will make us to make it more .
many of these systems have the effect .
they do n't like .
a the said once said to me , " the problem is that the is no longer going to take the baby to the world . "
everywhere in our public lives , our institutions , our institutions , this problem , this is to this and , but it leads to the opposite .
it 's people like people 's their to tasks their by taking them .
and can , any of can be any examples .
so , 's the goal .
the goal is to more , and that 's difficult to be if we want to be want to want to communicate and other and if we want to whether people or , or politicians , are , .
it 's not easy . you have to do it . simple reactions or not do n't know .
and now to the task .
and as this as a as of the , the .
because it suggests that you should trust and i trust .
we can do that for ourselves .
we can win a little bit .
so two people can improve their confidence .
but ultimately , it 's more by being that by being done by another .
you ca n't build the what other one .
you have to give you a to give you a trust .
so you have to be .
and of course , of course , is that you do n't usually people all at the nose .
but they need to have to have that they are .
how does this ?
this happens every day , everywhere . people do doing , very effective .
here 's a simple example .
the store , i made my hate , she put me up and ask them no questions .
they take them back and give me back to me , or some of the in the .
this is great . i 'm you , because you 've been me to me .
there 's a morality .
now you think of the as a , it 's a very good that you 're , and you to your own words .
so our goal is not really to recognize very difficult .
it 's relationships between people , and the the , when and if the other is .
so the morality of history is much about trust , or about faith , the by the or the , and much more about and how people , and evidence of the own .
thank you .
you know , the best thing i 'm most for me , i 'm looking for the films i can .
i love my own my own my with my kids , and my daughter was four years old , we 've together , " the " of . "
the film has n't longer left .
her , she was , of course , was the .
so she had a good excuse , a dress , and a the .
but if you look at this film , often look , you see how it is .
we live in the today and our children in a kind of a - a - size .
but " the was by .
he did n't have this trend .
it took 40 years to this trend , with -- a different movie , a guy from a , and a guy with a lot of a girl , and they the the as the as the the of the .
you know , i know what i 'm talking about , right ?
right .
well , there 's a big difference between these two , even several differences between the and all the movies that we 're today .
first of all , there are in " the of very violence .
the monkeys are pretty aggressive , as the the .
but i think if the had been by , today , would have said , " the , " the , you 're the the of that we were been .
use your shoes to order to read the computers , and the evil of evil . "
but it 's not happening .
another point i 'm i 'm the " is unique is that the and even more characters .
this is what i first time when i was my daughter , star , " and i was , years later , and was different .
at that time , i had a son .
he was at three years old .
he was n't invited to this . he was too young .
but he was the second child , and he was less than his sister .
so he 's a , and he 's the film , he 's a his mother 's mother , and i do n't think he 's understood what he was going on , but he it 's in .
and i wondered what he was doing .
did he think that courage , courage and ?
does he the that a army does n't take the government ?
he 's that there 's only boys in the , and of course , who is that really cool , but during the time , so that the heroes with a and a the to the , the he was
and they compare this with the " of "
how does your the your to a good end ?
by all the and a the .
this is the kind of world i my children my -- , right -- and not in the world , which is to , which is pretty much today .
why does it so much -- the movies that are children for our children , and so few so the ?
there 's a lot of good literature about the impact that on the boys , on the , and you should read them . it 's very good .
but i did n't read much about how guys with this .
i know from experience that the could n't the model that i could use to through the world of adults , and girls and girls in common .
i think there was this moment with the first kiss , when i really expect that the the starts , so that ends a movie , right ?
i have my mission , i to girl .
why are you there ?
i do n't know what to do .
the movies are very to the and its , and there 's not a lot of space for other and other .
it almost like as a young animal is a and when you 're a girl , you should better get better the .
there are exceptions , and i 'm going to be the the of any of you .
but they give you a message to the young boys that boys not be the .
they 're real to teach the girls how to the , but they show the boys not be how they to the .
there 's no matter for you .
there are also some women who are writing to write new stories for our kids and also are , are still more .
and the most common of all the time , the classic has been after the other , and every one of them is a young man , or a man , or two of men who are friends , and son and son , two men who have
until as many of you think of -- this year when they got the movie " -- the " the the . "
i recommend him all of you . he 's on the internet .
remember , what the said , " what 's the " ?
" oh , i ca n't believe that has made a the . "
it 's very good . let 's not take it that .
but as no one did n't like this movies , the has the .
i do n't know if you 've heard about it .
it has n't have n't really , and meaning , but maybe we 're going to start today .
the is a the and in the middle of the the that brought her with a girlfriend that the had that had seen .
it 's very simple . there are just three questions you need to : there 's more than one character in the film , which is , and something ?
try to get that one .
and talk about women in the of the time ?
and what 's in their entertainment is something else , than the guy they like ?
how ? thank you .
thank you .
two women who exist and talk about anything .
this is what happens . i saw it , and yet i see it pretty rare in the movies that we know and love .
in fact , i went to the week in a to a very good movie , " the . "
you remember ? a lot of a in the the , great the , a general sense of what a good - is .
it falls with the the .
i think that should n't do it because of the time -- i do n't know if you 've seen it , but a lot of the 's playing in a message where men and women during the .
there are some good scenes that men in this deep , by the , and the great moment , one of the the , is to door and say , " you go bed ? "
this is some of .
so let 's look at look at the numbers .
in 2011 , under the 100 of movies , what do you think of how many of these were actually ?
11 . that 's not a .
it 's not as many of as the number of women who just congress , so that 's good .
but there 's a number that bigger than this is and this is will be this space .
last year , the new york times published the government .
you think that you 're saying that you .
one of five women in the united states that they 've been to be in their life .
i do n't think that 's the fault of general .
i do n't think that 's going to do anything about anything .
i do n't even think that and directly to do with something , but something 's going on , and when i hear this statistics , one of the things i think is that many are .
who are these guys ? what are they doing ?
what do you learn to learn ?
take your story , that it 's the task of a male , to prevent the the violence and then the , which is a woman who does n't have friends and not talking about it ?
so let 's take this story ?
you know , as a parent that has privilege , a daughter , just like the same of the same thing , we find this world and these statistics very and we want to .
we 've got to how we , and we hope hoping that help , but i 'm also asking if whether 's going to protect , at the same time , active or , our , our , "
the key is a means that we can do something very important , and i 'm talking to the .
i think we need to do our new just a new definition of
the definition of the is already changing .
you read how the new york of the and the .
they 're going to mess .
our sons will find a way to a new relationship , and i think we really have to show you that a is man who is his and on your side and really the bad guys who are women
i think we should be looking for the the to find the that if we find them , and find the search that are the real courage , and people and to these and say , " i 'm on side
when i was my daughter , who " who " wars , " you know what they said ?
the .
the and the .
what these have common ?
maybe it 's not just the most dress .
i think these two figures are experts .
these are the characters in the that more than others and their knowledge to with other people to help them to their potential full of .
and also , they leaders .
i this kind of job for my daughter and i do this kind of job for my son .
i want to do more tasks like this .
i want to do less tasks in my son , " and " and " and , and he 's to a team , maybe a team that will be to better people better , better people better , and how people like
thank you .
i want to talk to you about the story of a the .
i do n't know his name , but it 's his story .
he lives in a small village in south .
his village lies near .
the most successful poverty of this village and the the .
and when there was nothing there was him , he left his village , and he walked into town in this case , the , the capital .
as he , there is no opportunities , no jobs , no way .
at the end , he 's in a outside of the .
it may be a year , but nothing .
one day , he will take a man from a man who him to lunch , to dinner , to the breakfast ,
he 's this group of young people , and they give him a chance .
he gets a little money to buy new clothes to feed money to home .
this is him young .
he .
he starts to new a new life .
his life has a sense .
on a beautiful day in the , the , a walk into the air .
this the with was the and the and dynamic group of young people was the to a with .
how could the story of a the that just to in the in the ?
he had waited .
he had an opportunity to come on the future , and a , and it was the first opportunity to him .
it was the first thing to call him from a state that we call " the . "
and his story is always over again over the areas of around the world .
it 's the story of the , the youth , which is in and something than a . "
young people are from the city , from their jobs , jobs , wealth , but , but young people do n't have to share the wealth of their cities .
often it 's the youth that are under the high - .
2030 three five in five cities in the cities as 18 years .
if we do n't young people to the growth of cities , if we do n't have opportunities , they 're " , the in the violence , violence in the .
in my favorite , 70 percent of young people are under unemployment .
70 percent have no work , do n't go to school .
they do n't actually do anything .
last month , i went back to after the , and i went to the the , where hospital where i was born .
i remember , i was standing up this hospital , and i asked what would if i would be here ?
what if i had to the same condition of " forced ?
would i be become ?
i 'm not sure what i 'm going to do .
the reason for this was in was the fact , a of a young leaders and entrepreneurs .
i was about 90 young leaders .
we together and we started a to a solutions of the of the city .
in the room , a young man , the .
he went to university in and his .
there was no jobs and no options .
i remember he told me that he had a the , and was frustrated , the perfect goal is to be member , and other .
they 're people like him .
but this story takes another different .
in , the biggest obstacles are to from b , streets .
23 years , the have completely , that the best is best .
and the , the opportunity and they .
he 's a .
he began to stop on the , could n't afford to afford .
and with his family and friends , he bought his 10 , and he , and he was going to be able to get his in the next three years .
how do you tell this story from the other ?
what makes the difference ?
i think it 's a ability to a new opportunity .
it 's the the , and i think that the means that the means to be " means . "
it 's the young people to do the economic opportunity that which they 're desperately .
you can teach people to be entrepreneurs .
i want to talk to you about a young guy who one of my favorite , : the , a the .
he helped me to give the some of some young people who are at the summit , and to show them how to build and .
he 's actually the first the that has been since 22 years , until before was there , the the was that was the by the ship from the abroad , when you wanted to the wedding of the wedding .
if you asked someone , " when did you last time you ever seen this last time ? " then the answer of many of the during the , " never . "
so saw an opportunity .
he was a the with a .
he was a outside of and started to the and the to what he said , in the climate .
he started to take to with flowers , and he was in and , and to around the city , and he was working on the first of the public in the last years .
there 's no public parks in the .
he wants to create a place where families and young people are together , and he says , he can teach the beautiful things about life .
just 's the , it does n't because it 's because too much water .
so the first step is to young people to inspire , and in this room , has had a huge impact on the other people in the room .
they had never really thought about it a .
they thought to work for a work or for government , but this story , its innovation , had a strong impact on them .
he the them to look their city as a place of view .
he them to be entrepreneurs , they could change .
so the end of the day , they had innovative solutions for some of the greatest challenges of their .
they had local solutions to local .
the inspiration of young people , and the of a is a big , but young people need to their ideas .
they need and to develop her business and develop business .
they bring people with the resources that they need , they give them to give them to support to make ideas , and they 'll be to for growth .
for me , me , more than just a of a .
it 's about social .
the - selling sell not just flowers .
i think he sold to hope .
his 's is called " when it created the view of people to their city .
the has the who to help him to stop the and the .
he gave them the chance to the state of state of "
these young businesses have a tremendous impact on their cities .
so my suggestion is , you to young people to get people , and their own innovations and you 'll talk about stories about flowers and " instead of " and "
thank you .
so during my childhood , my was my favorite , looking at looking for the on the on the , because my parents were the happiness .
but these are hard to find .
they 're from sand , barely .
but after a certain period , i had a .
i started to see , and patterns that helped me , they .
and this was to finding a passion to find things that i think , and to the .
and when i started studying , realized , i realized that see that my eyes n't eyes with my eyes .
because suddenly , in my beach , in a the , along the the , and my the grew up to the size of cities .
and that led me to use .
i had to see differently to see the past in a map .
i want to show you how we example we if we use .
this is a gentleman that went in the eastern called the .
and the appears , we use , but we 're it , and it with color , this is suddenly that suddenly .
what you see here , the changes of landscape through the and the of the old egyptians .
what i want to share with you today is how we used to find a city that which the name , and for thousands of years .
the was the capital of the old egypt , as a long - year - , a rich in a , about years ago .
the is the in the , and it 's very efficient , because it 's in the middle realm of arts and architecture and religion .
and , knew always that the of the somewhere near the , the two , the red , but in the massive , but in this massive .
this area is huge -- the area is four times three miles .
at the , the , the , the at the the , and , while , and moves , and , towards the west , it 's the city .
so how do you find a city in a .
and you 're to find to be that equivalent to find the needle in the , with eyes and the .
so we used to the - to - map of a landscape of order to see able to see a slide .
where the of the of used to be used .
but you see , and this is very interesting , this very complex - dimensional , with circle that 's us a position for the city .
so we worked with the scientists , to the what you see here .
this is like the ice , just instead of the layers , change , change , you can , human .
in a depth of five , under a layer of ancient , we found a density layer from the .
so this shows that this position for you can be in five feet , we can find more over several hundred years of carbon to a to the , to the to the , which we the existence of existence .
we found the -- the , the , the and -- which shows that 's a has a .
it might not seem to look at much , but if you look at the the stones , which were used by the in the rich , you find these rocks .
so we found a density layer of the the that on the rich .
we found for a for the society , which shows that this is a very important city .
and it 's n't even there , but we 'll going to get back to this site , to a map .
what 's important , we to work for young who are in the school , so they 're so to who can make great discoveries .
so i wanted to with my from my middle - , -- it was perhaps in the city of the years ago years ago .
" knowledge , is the biggest of all the .
there 's nothing in this in the . "
ted was n't 1984 .
ideas , but actually , 1984 about nothing long , long , from .
you can see , you can compare the in the .
thank you very much .
thank you .
i grew up in taiwan as a daughter of a , to my memories , like my beauty , the and the form of the chinese .
i was , i was fascinated by this incredible language .
but for a , it seems like as the great wall of china is going to be china .
i 've been wondering how i this , so anybody who has to be interested in this complex and this understanding and .
i thought that was a new way of learning , to be useful .
since five , i learned every single every single every single in every single in every single .
i 've spent every day in the next 15 years .
because we have just have five minutes to have a and very difficult to be very useful .
a chinese the has about 20,000 .
you need just 1,000 thousand for a simple the .
the most important 200 you are to 40 percent of the simple to understand -- enough to enough , to understand the and the of the .
today , i start with eight to show you how the method works .
are you ready ?
open your mouth as possible until it 's .
it 's going to be a mouth . "
that person goes to a person .
" human . "
when the the for " fire " a human with , if he looks like , " , " help ! " -- and the the is the of the , but i like this idea . take you to the best .
this is a tree .
" tree . "
this is a mountain .
the sun is . "
the moon .
the the for " looks like a wild from the .
these eight are radical .
they are the the to create a variety of .
a human .
if someone else is someone , it means " follow . "
and then , more , " and " and " a " a . "
if a human his poor , says , " this man was "
the person in mouth , it 's like .
he 's a " , " as the 's in the whale .
a tree is a tree two trees are a for a " . "
three are represent for a " forest . "
and you put a under tree , and you have a "
put it up a mouth up , it means " it 's "
just to remember because is a is a is a is a .
remember , fire ?
two black people are hot .
three fire together are a lot of " . "
and they put the fire under two trees , it means " . "
it 's us the sun the source of the .
two together are together . "
three together are together . "
if the sun goes up and the moon , it means "
in the context , it 's be for the next day .
the sun goes across the horizon .
door . a in the door stands to the " the . "
so , put a mouth into the door , it , " ask questions . "
the , the . is somebody there ?
this person the from the door . " , "
the left is the woman .
two women are two for a " . "
now , in three women , this is called " the . "
we 've now 30 .
and this method can do this to the first eight words in the first
the next group of eight are up with other words .
with a little bit of a , a few hundred , a child - old child .
if we can make these , we start them .
for example , it makes and fire , the , so "
we know , japan is the land of the sun .
this is the sun with " because japan is because of 's not .
it 's a to with a called "
a human being a to do ?
a japanese . "
the white on the are two mountains of .
in chinese , it means " chinese , " chinese , their political chinese in the dark of the mountains .
today , " . "
a mouth says , it says , " it . "
this is the slide that reminds me to leave the stage . thank you .
