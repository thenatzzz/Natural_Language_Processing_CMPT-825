when i was in my 20s , i had my first the .
i was a and i studied up in berkeley , berkeley .
she was a woman named alex .
when the came up the first , she was sitting and a , and she fell on the office in my office , her of and she would be there about talk about talk .
and when i heard that , i was a .
my , had a patient for the first patient .
and i got a woman in the people who wanted to talk about .
i 'll leave that , i thought .
but i did n't have it .
with the stories , the alex with the , was easy to me just to head with head as we 're faced problems .
" 30 is the new 20 " said alex , and i did n't know the she had right .
work came later , later came later , later came later , later came later .
people in the , and alex , i did n't have anything time .
but soon , my was my god , the .
i was going to .
i said , " yeah , you 're you 're with your with your , you with a , but you 're not going to marry . "
and there said , " my , " not yet , but maybe you 'll going to be the next .
and also , the best time to work on marriage , before they married . "
this is what psychologists call a the .
that was the moment that i realized that the 30 was not the new 20 .
yes , people are the as well as a , but did n't mean any of the to the .
and this was alex out of the , and we had the , and we sat and them .
and i realized that this kind of the was a problem with a consequences with only consequences , and their , but for the , and all of people in the .
at that point , in the united states , 50 million people in the .
we talk about 15 percent of the population , or 100 percent if you say that nobody can achieve the without going to go through the .
if you , you 're in your way .
i want to see a few of you .
oh , yeah ! you 're all incredible .
if you work with somebody in the , a loves , because you , you , you know , i 'm you see -- . people . really people in the really important .
my , my are in people in the , because i think that every single million should know what psychologists , and the wisdom of the most of the most of the most things that you can do for happiness , maybe even
this is not my opinion . that 's facts . facts .
we know that 80 percent of the moments of the moments are to 35 to 35 .
that means that 10 of 10 decisions , experience and experiences , living with life , which is what you 're , until you 're going to be , 30 , you 're going to be .
do n't you if you 're over 40 .
this group is going to be well , i think .
we know that the first 10 years of a of a whole impact on how money .
we know that more than half of americans are married or with the future partner or a relationship .
we know that brain is going to be the second and big grow in the and for the , whatever you want to do , you now time to do this .
we know that the that during the more than the , and in the life and the of the women are with their peak and after 35 .
so in the , you should be the over the body and the possibilities .
if we think about the development of a child , we know that the first five years for years and are in the brain .
it 's the time that the ordinary , life has a impact on the future .
but we hear about little bit about there 's something like and our have a time .
but the people get to people in the .
the press talking about the the of the .
scientists call the a .
journalists , the the of people in the like " the " or " . "
that 's true .
so , as culture , we have the what the decade is the .
the , that things that things are a little bit and a little bit little bit . time .
is n't that ?
so what happens when you put someone in the head , head , and say , " you , you 10 years to make a good life of life ? "
nothing .
this person is the the and the the . and it 's not going to .
and so every day , people in the people like your sons and daughters into my office and say something like , " i know my friend does n't good me , but these n't do n't . " i 'm just saying that time
or you say , " all , i 've been able to do it for 30 years , it 's all good . "
but later , it sounds like , " my is almost and i did n't have a the .
i had a better when i had college . "
and then it sounds like , " in my , like the journey . jerusalem .
all the and they had fun , but then , 30 came up with the music , and everybody began to everybody .
i did n't want to be the only that was happening . i sometimes i , i my husband , because he was in my chair .
where are the people in the ?
does n't do that .
ok , that 's easy to say , but it does n't make mistakes , because it 's about much .
if things is to the , there 's a enormous pressure to go through a , a city , a city , a partner and two or three children or two children or three children .
and many of these things are the and like the are now just the and so all of all the time in the .
the does n't mean to buy a red .
it means you want to make the career you do n't want to do .
you ca n't have this kid you want to want , or ca n't want to be able .
too many people in the and , and myself and myself and me , say , " what 's i did ? what i ? "
i want to change what people do in the and .
this is a story that shows how it can .
it 's the story of .
in my , my when she was 25 , she had her , a .
she said she 'd work in the art or the , but she did n't have decided that would have been in the last few years .
because was cheaper , she lived with her friend who more than his .
and even though their were , were their years before they were worse .
they often in the , but then she would her and said , " your family could you , you , your friends . "
one day , came very and almost for the hour .
she had bought a bought , and she spent all morning , her deal , but then she came to the , which was called the words , " in the , " in the "
she was almost the when she came up and said , " who 's going to be for me if i have a car ?
who will be me when i have cancer ? "
i moment , i had to myself to say not to say , " i . "
but the real no music , really , to look .
a needed took a better life , and i knew this was her opportunity .
i had my a my first time to my to , just like the .
and in the next weeks , months , i was three - , i anyone to everybody , whether or , or , should be .
first of all , i told you , she had n't have any , they would be a .
so i to you to something that would be the .
power to do something you is investment , invest in something you might be next .
i knew n't know about the and no one knows how the future of work , but i know : the .
so now , time is this job , this , this the , which is trying to try .
i 'm not the of the of the but the , who n't count , by the way , they do n't have any .
this is the .
i said to , the , but , but what .
second , i said , the urban is .
good friends are to get to the airport , but , the of people who are like you , so that they what they think what they 're talking about and where they work .
this new to the of the most often outside of the own .
new things are made of " the " from friends
it 's true : the half of the is not or not .
but the other half it 's not and they the them .
half of jobs never have . if you 're the boss to your neighbors , your the does n't have a job .
this is not a little bit .
the last advice : what believed you could n't choose the family , but the friends .
this was for her as she was , but as you , you soon to your own your own family , if you 're a partner and a family .
i said her , the time , a new family , would be .
you might think that it 's better than you 're to 20 than 20 or 25 or and i agree to you .
but the , you 're or , you live in your facebook , is not an progress .
the best time to your marriage before , before you have a , and that means that the means of the in love in love in your love .
your family , means , consciously , the and the what you want , and not , because it works , or anybody to the time that you 're just .
so what happened to do ?
we went through her and found them the of a the who in a in a museum .
this weak band that you get to get a work .
and this gave this reason to her friend her friend with her .
now , five years later , it 's the for museums .
she has a man who made her .
she loves her new and new family and she told me a map in the , said , " now the line is " in the , you do n't get enough . "
sounds like sounds like this , it 's all simple . but that 's what i love about .
it 's so easy to help them .
in the , like the planes , who just left the and to west .
and after the , a little bit of the difference make whether you or in .
this is true for the , the , or the , a good conversation , a beautiful , a very clear can have a tremendous impact for years and even over generations .
this is an idea that all of the that you know .
it 's just as simple i to .
i 've the privilege of what makes such a day of everyday : the are not the new , so you on a lot of a , you use your own your own family .
do n't tell you what you n't , not .
you 're going to live now .
thank you .
in the entire industry , it was always our goal to connect between us and information , the gap between our physical world and the world on the screen where we can our imagination .
and this is smaller , smaller , and now it 's smaller than a millimeter that 's a of a , and computers for every .
but i wondered what it would be if there was no limit .
i looked like what would look like .
first i 've this tool that i into the digital world , so if you focus on the screen , you it to the physical .
designers can put their ideas directly into 3d and surgeons , to can be on to the screen of the screen .
so this tool was this tool , the was so the .
but our hands still outside the .
how can we connect the with the digital information and interact the whole of the our hands of our hands ?
in microsoft , i 've done with my mentor the , the , computer , and a room a the room of the keyboard in a digital .
that a that screen that screen and screen can make the of fingers and face , and you can put his hands from the keyboard , put the and with the hands .
there 's windows and a position in the room , you can easily as you can a book from a shelf .
then you can through this book and you and , and all this on the of the the .
architects can their hands and .
so in these two examples , we are going to digital .
but how if we take that all the time and the digital information that we us ?
i 've sure many of you have already done to read articles online later .
but now you have n't worry about it anymore .
here i have a " the . "
this view is you through a of your head or the , if you understand the system is geometry .
this idea of idea , i started thinking about it , the n't just look in the space , but it 's to make it , so we can them and feel .
how would a look like this ?
in mit media lab , i with my the and my collaborators the , a block .
now , in this case , this is like a major - in our world , that means that computers , people can see this object everywhere -- at least this little bit of the .
effectively we have the gravity and the control and control the by cheap the , and these .
by the digital program , we it through from the through the constraints and space , and then , a lot of movements , and in the real world .
so example can of over the of or , or the , and again , and be in the real world .
students can use this to use complex concepts of physics and physics and physics and unlike a the or the , or a is a and experience that experience and it 's very powerful .
and more than that , what we have now is now to , is to imagine how the of the world is even transform our everyday activity .
as you can , digital will not only not only us to show us , but to interact with interact with our as our physical , ourselves of our world .
today , we 've begun by talking about borders , but if we continue to limit border , the only frontier our imagination .
thank you .
i was been to for two years to become a the , in china , china , in the 1970s .
when i was in the first grade , i wanted to get government to school for school , all paid .
but my mother said , " no . " . "
my parents wanted me to engineer how she 's going to be .
after they the , they believed , they believed that the only way to happiness is a safer and good job .
it 's not matter if i do n't care or job .
but my dream was to become a chinese the .
i 'm that i do on my .
a has to do very early with the start with so i , and i tried to try to go into the .
i wrote even at the and the to the of a .
but the adult does n't give my idea .
the adults did n't believe it was seriously me .
only my friends were me , but they were also just as children as i as myself .
and i was 15 years old , i knew that i was too old to with training .
so my dream would never be true .
i was afraid to that i could only to my rest of my life .
but that 's so .
so i had to look in my head , i could find another .
no one there to me ?
so i to .
i my the of with a book and a book of the the of the , " i was my in a , the the tradition , " by the book i learned to be done by the "
[ " the " ] [ " ] " the history of " the ] the , i came in the united states , and what did i did i read ?
of course , books that are in china .
" the good earth " is about the life of chinese .
it just simply not as propaganda . i understood .
the bible is interesting , but weird .
but that 's a subject for another time .
but the fifth commandment taught me a way of " , " you want your father and your mother . "
" honor " i thought , " that 's so different and much better than a . "
that was my way to and to and the and relationship to my parents .
through with a new culture , i started reading .
this was a lot of explosion .
for example , i did n't really get this very interesting first because chinese students are with this .
it never occurred to me that china is not going to be in the center of the world .
so a tells something about personal .
the reading is actually nothing new .
in the academic world , it 's a the .
there 's even the like the and the .
comparison and a understanding of a .
so i thought if you read reading in the in the research , why does n't work in daily ?
so i began to read two books at the same time .
you can act by people -- [ " franklin by the , " john " by john adams , david ] that was the same , or friends with common experiences .
[ " we , " from " the " -- " life is a of the the of the -- stories different cultures , like joseph the . " joseph " ] christ and had to had to be three of .
in were , the , the political and the nature .
they were all nature : they were all nature : , and social -- interesting .
if you turn a physical language , it 's fun to read the the of in the languages .
[ " the " for a " the " the of the water -- the the of the the " by alan the , rather than me in translation , i figured out how much i can .
i 'm to think of by , i think , " happiness " happiness " happiness " happiness . "
" in " means " means " new mother . "
books is like an alien , by , i 'm i to one connection to the people and the present .
i know that i never feel more or i 'm feel .
a dream is really compared to what many other have .
i came to come to that it 's not the only purpose of a single job . true .
his purpose is to get to in , where dreams is our .
even a dream can be this purpose .
because of course , i 'm here today here today , happy , again with a purpose in life and with a lot of time .
you 're always be like to be .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
when i was eight years old , a new girl was in new class , the class , and she was so , as girls as a new girl .
she had the hair and a little the , was good at a and .
i was in until i , until i until i had a the plan .
so i stayed a little bit longer school in school , a longer , and i was stuck in the the .
when the air was , i came into , i took into the classroom , i took the the of the .
and then i did .
i the my notes of my the , just some few .
all the the .
when i wanted to make the book , i noticed that i some of my other were pretty good for the other .
so i in the all of the , without imagination .
i gave all of all and i myself because i was because i was also time .
i 'm still more about my behavior .
i do n't understand where the thought came .
i do n't understand why i was so good at that .
i felt really good .
i do n't even know why i never been for .
it was so obvious .
i never got caught .
but most of me , me why it so that little girl was so ?
i 'm not happy .
she 's so , .
we know babies under .
similarly : primates . primates the are inherently from very natural .
we know that the of is among in the united states .
but i never a study that i could their or their or their .
so we need to the literature , because the novel is the laboratory that in the in the context of their forms .
is it a to say that if we do n't have a , we have no have no have ?
so no the , " no " . "
no the king , not " out of the night . "
no shakespeare .
because , the of the because we lose , " and " the " the " the . "
no do n't do a , no the . i know that 's in to say that the answer has everything has done , but in the , but it 's really it .
this is what we 're going to take the , and on the the of " for " for the " time , " and his analysis of the sexual - and the of the , the thing that we have hope .
think about think , is it ?
we think of the little boy that we try to sleep .
we think about a piece of cake , in the .
we forget how to his vision .
we forget how it is .
these are books for the as the .
i do n't know how the is , but let 's say it 's a .
let 's look at why the and the , the and so well .
is it obvious that , to -- , such a basis for a story ?
i do n't know . i think it 's just hard to the , because think what happens when we 're .
when we 're a , we tell ourselves a story .
tell us stories about the lives of other people and make them feel bad because they 're so much that it 's bad .
as an artist of the history and the audience we know what the detail to you to do to bring the knife into the right ?
we do all of us to and , and that 's to .
in the first band , " in world , the , one of the great , thinks about his care and , as you as it , and , " i wait , i love this woman would love someone
everything you give me and joy , might be even happy to joy , even in this moment . "
that 's the story that he tells about , and from there to the that every new of , he discovered at his , his the of his the .
we 've got to admit that the and the are the .
and friends have to leave the country if they want to with it .
but you do n't need to be to get to realize that it 's hard . right ?
there 's a .
it 's a feeling that 's to be .
what does the ?
i 'm going to be .
i want to .
i 'd like to speak the hair and little .
i like to photos .
so that 's why it 's so successful .
basically , the language of the science and science and the .
when these the were the , suddenly out of the door , and the of his the of his the , he this behavior .
he says , " you may think that 's a terrible , but it 's not nothing to a text or a " . "
he says , " there 's scientific value worth . "
and what 's trying to show us is that the is and makes us look , but in her core , you know a search for truth , the truth , and the , : the more , the better , the better
now , loss , that 's for the way to wisdom .
he says , " a woman that we need to suffer us , us a greater and a more and more than the genius of a man who 's interested . "
he tells us about that we should look at women ?
no . i think he 's to say that us that us to tell us about ourselves .
is there another different sense that we us in this particular way ?
even though we feel different our hidden and our ?
and we do n't feel different with different kinds of sound ?
freud , later , write .
one day was a was a by a very young man who was by the thought of his wife , him his wife .
and freud says , this man is kind of strange , because he does n't even know what his wife does .
because she 's innocent , and everybody knows that .
the poor creature is the under the .
instead , he looking for his , without it , .
she too or she to with a man ?
[ freud ] says that the man is to the of the of his wife .
the novel is very good at this point .
the novel describes very well , how much hard us , but not .
because the more we are , the more we it to us .
so i think that way that we do n't get to do things or illegal things .
i 'm to be very .
i think about eight years , but i think also the story i 've heard in the news .
a woman from michigan was written , because she was by a self - the for a year , the messages himself
a year .
she tried to get the new friend of her shoes into the shoes and i to , when i heard , i was with .
because ... let 's be honest .
what does it mean , if creativity , creativity , right ?
this is something from a novel .
this is something from a novel of the .
the is one of my favorite .
she 's the most the and most woman the american .
from her , two - year - year - " the the mr. , " , books , how to -- how to keep our mind , and we 're in the realm of the rich that are in the of what 's could be -- be
take a the , your character .
first , all want to be tom , and they have , and they them and they what they once , and they 're , from the , and he responds on their name , he name their her .
this is a method .
but what do we do ? we ca n't do it as tom .
i ca n't give the world , even though i 'd like to do it for some days .
it 's a shame , because we live in a period .
we live in a " - era . time .
we are all good social media that are is .
does the novel the ? i 'm not sure .
but we do what do if they 're not safe if they 're in a of a .
so we go to street and ask questions to the .
think about think about the , you think about professor as a professor , this great .
but i liked always the , the boss of the with face , the the needs , needs , the the genius , it 's to him .
that 's me familiar .
so , needs his help , put it him and the stories of stories .
but as you start to start starts to something , and eventually in " the six , as the , and all of his solution , the the is to the and says , " we 're not the on them , mr. the .
we 're proud . "
and he 's that there 's no - to - the - , the n't want to shake the shake .
that 's one of the few times that we can see the in the stories , and i think this little very smart , but also 's a , .
it seems like this is not an emotional , but a problem .
in a moment , a moment is a on a different of like .
and the next moment , they 're on a wavelength .
suddenly it 's to it , this genius , he has him .
is it really easy ?
what if really were really a problem , if it 's just how we deal with the other relationship ?
maybe we would n't be to be the same .
we could choose .
but i like the .
while we 're waiting for , we still have the literature as a .
literature alone , the .
literature alone , they can , .
and who 's all the : the good news , the tom , the crazy the , the .
we 're in society .
thank you .
i was about 10 years old and on a the - old with my father in my father , a the - in the northern of the new york .
it was a great day .
the forest .
the sun would look the petals the rock like glass , and if no have been no , you would have almost to be that we were going to be through the forest .
we came to our .
i saw the little hut on a cliff and a across a the , beautiful , as something called me .
behind the roof , a , four square , with the , the and a old the .
i was amazed , i was angry and confused .
the were lazy to what they had -- who they thought , would they would to ?
the question was asked me , and i ask them to ask them :
who we after us ?
how do you think it or where " us might be , who behind us behind us ?
who 's behind us behind rio in or in paris or in london ?
this is in new york new york the of every day of the tons of tons and 2000 tons of tons .
i wanted to them -- as individuals .
i wanted to understand who job .
how is it to wear a uniform and wear ?
so i started a with them .
i drove the , the and went to and went to offices and all the city , and i learned a lot , but i still a .
i had to go deeper .
so i took a job as a the .
i was not just with the , i was the .
and i was the mechanical the and the snow .
it was a wonderful privilege and a experience .
everybody asks after the .
he 's there , but not as you think , and days , it 's really bad , you 're pretty fast .
you to do you just to you .
i know people who were this number of years , and their bodies still on weight their body , tons of from every week .
and then there 's the danger .
after the statistics of the , the is the under the country in the country , and i learned why .
you 're all the day , you 're all over .
everybody wants to and often do n't have to .
that 's really bad for workers .
and the garbage itself is full of the that the from the the and terrible .
i learned also about the the of the .
if you look from the , and the of the of the city a city , you can see that the is like a itself .
he does n't listen to .
it 's also like a kind of like the or the .
it 's always to be in motion .
and then there 's the stigma .
you put the uniform and , until somebody -- whatever -- whatever -- whatever you 're going to you traffic the traffic or the or a , or you a coffee your own your , and you and you and you say ,
i find this particular because i believe that believe that the staff of the most important of the city of the city . that 's three reasons .
they 're the of the health .
if you do n't waste the waste , every day and efficient and , it would take out of the the and the and the would continue to us on very .
diseases that we 've been achieved for decades and , and would be and us .
the economy takes it .
if we do n't do the old , we do n't have a place for the new , the motors of the start to the , when the is the .
i do n't know the capitalism , i just the .
and then that 's what i call our , .
so i 'm just by how fast we 're now in today .
we do n't care about why our or our , or we 're .
we take them , throw them away , forget , because we know people on the other side that are care about .
so i want to today some ways today , how to think about thinking about how to improve and them into this , how you create a city that are sustainable and .
and work , i think , is kind of the .
you can see the streets every day .
they carry in many .
you know when you expect to expect .
and their work does our .
they 're like a .
the that you , let us imagine ourselves before ourselves before our , our , the and has to be more to any price .
on days after september , i was the of the a of the on the street , and my son and son and the and there was a man who his , he does .
and i tried to work him for him -- that day , days , but i started to cry .
and he looked at me and just and said , " everything 's fine . "
" everything is fine . "
first later , i started to my research and the .
his name is the , and we worked together , we finally , we had good friends .
i wanted to believe that the was right .
everything is good .
but in our efforts , change the way we on this planet as well , we need to pay all the cost of including the very cost of work .
and we have to be informed to help people who do this work , the experience , how we systems about to develop , from which is a last of years of the country and to a different species of waste species that are can be transformed
the more fundamental , we think about when we talk about power , three percent of the national .
it 's a remarkable statistic .
in your daily , in your lifetime , your life , you next you see somebody 's job is to give you a car , you take a moment time you 're .
take a moment to get yourself .
hello , what is ?
that 's not enough .
hello , what is ?
my name is the and i 'm not drunk , but the doctor of my birth already .
he 's got six directions and me , little bit of the air .
so i what i 'm doing is what i means i
look .
it 's a . i 'm a of the , the and .
it 's not genetically .
it 's not a the . you ca n't get it .
nobody has the of my mother 's , and i did n't get it because my parents are so afraid what they are .
you get them through , like the day of my birth .
i have to warn you . i 'm not a source of inspiration , and i do n't want anybody to me here with me because you all have been in a point in your life .
and just 's just going to .
it 's just a christmas in christmas , and you see the beautiful circles of looking for a and what you see ?
the .
and you thinks , " why ca n't i be a little bit ? "
i have to say you , i 'm problems , and only is one of them .
if there was a of the , i a .

the park in new jersey is my hometown .
i love the fact that my favorite and my have the same .
and i love , i love the fact that i could go to my home from new york city , if i wanted to .
many people do n't do with hot , but my parents not n't to a " . "
the mantra was my father , " yes , you can . "
so if my three older sisters older , i with .
when my three older sisters on school , my parents my school , so i could go , and if we were n't all of the the , we all the of my mother .
my father taught me to walk when i was five , by using my feet on his feet and just the .
another one of his was to put a full of my nose into my own so i them .
my inner was very strong , and as -- yeah , on the first day in kindergarten , i was like a who had a .
there was only six only in my city in my city and all my family were .
today we have 20 in the city , and they 're still all my family .
i think no one has ever noticed that we do n't have a .
this was before , before it took for a , " i hate to use as a .
people i grew up with did n't have with my faith .
but they were really worried that i could possibly to maybe perhaps .
i explained that i was to live by three months three months , so the from to the to a .
i have the .
yes , on the , totally crazy .
my parents could n't afford to afford , and they me to the .
i learned how to make on - based , so i can walk on .
and i 'm from the , where it really important to be , so if my friends were married , i also .
and if my friends were their off on the coast of the , i do n't .
i spent my summer in summer because i my parents were afraid that we if we could n't get every single summer every year , one day .
the the often that my dad wanted me to me , so i was milk to the of the , into the dead sea , and i still know how the water in the eyes , i thought , " it worked ! it worked
but we found a , : .
i have to say it 's really boring , but before i did , i was a , not even not n't even .
now i can stand on head .
my parents always me that i was able to make sure that not was not impossible , and my dream was it was called the the general . "
because of , i got a great scholarship of the the , the who was the state , because i 'm every minority of .
i was kind of the of the .
all loved me .
i do n't like all of the homework , so , all of all of my classes , getting in all of these .
every time i a scene from " the the , my teacher .
but i never got a role .
so in my the , the , the piece of a piece of " the dance " dance , it 's .
a piece of a girl .
i was a girl with a .
so i everywhere , " finally , i have a role !
i have a !
finally !
thank god , thank you , i 'm free ! "
i did n't have the role .
the brown had got the role .
i was to the of the , i the , when someone had my cat , and she asked why she said me , she said that i would n't want to do the .
i said , " sorry , but if i ca n't , if you ca n't do the character . "
i was born to this that , and she gave them a without a .
college the life .
hollywood is known for physically healthy .
after i went back to my first role was as a the in a the .
my dream was true .
and i knew that i was soon to say "
but instead , i was a the that was just the , and i realized that the did n't have a , .
they just perfect people .
but i 'm afraid of the rule .
i grew up with the , the and the and all of these women had a common : they were the .
so i became the .
my first job was to famous york city from new york city new york new , and i 'm never going the face of the first time i ever , forget , he realized that were to the streets to new jersey with a the with a the
i was in america , the united states , i 've also been the east on the east , the and the .
some people say , i 'm the first the in the arab world .
i do n't like to ask the first , but i know that you never heard about the bad little bit of women are not , and they 're us to .
2003 , my brother from a mother father , dean the , and i 'm the new york of american that already .
our goal was to the most exciting image of americans from the media and to the at the point that , and , and not .
the of the was much easier than the challenge the of .
my big breakthrough was 2010 .
i was been to the in the the " the " the " the . "
i was like to the the the , i was to me into a studio and i me to a chair .
so i looked at the , and said , " sorry , i get another chair ? "
and she looked at me , and she said , " five , four , three , two ... "
and we were live ! live !
so i had to go on the table of the table , so i did n't get the screen , the when the interview was finished , i was .
there was my chance , and i had her , and i knew that i never me back .
but mr. the invited me , but , made me a and a and my chair .
working with work with keith , i learned , all the internet on the internet .
people say , kids are more , but as a child or adults , or never been me .
in the world wide web , i 'm with my of my the .
when i look at online , i see like , " the , why this like ? "
" the , is the the ? "
and my favorite : " the .
did you have ?
we should be for them . "
even , my disability into the the : the , the , the , the .
disability is such as .
if a ca n't play a video game , ca n't play a play .
the are the biggest -- yes -- yes . it 's a one value .
people are the biggest minority of the world , and we are the the in the the .
the doctors said , i never walk , i 'm sitting here .
but i was to social media , i would n't be here .
i hope that we can take a picture of in the media and create the .
maybe there 's no way at the internet that if there were more positive to more positive .
or maybe not .
maybe it 's still a village to a child .
my journey with the me to a very special places .
i put on the red next red next to the and the the .
i was a in a film with adam and with my , with amazing , .
i 'm as a the with the the , " the the the the .
i was a huge the of the new jersey in the national center .
i 've " the 's " , " a the who tries to provide the of a chance that my parents . me .
but the one that the most -- before this -- the most of the , when i was before the , how a , and like a bee , the , and the way exactly as i as i .
this was the only time that my father ever a of me and i was going to talk to this talk .
: god your soul is your dad , dad . my name is the , " if i can , you can also that . "
there was a time we 're big .
on the 21st , july , the from the of the apollo and the , and the to the of the .
armstrong and the were alone , but their presence on the top of the was the peak of a the , the .
the was the biggest largest in the history of the united states of america .
to moon , it 's about billion dollars worth of worth , four percent of the the .
apollo was created for people , and the collaboration of the companies , universities and universities .
people died , including the of the apollo .
but until the end of the end of 24 , 24 people to the moon .
from the that its surface , is the , after death of the last year , now the oldest .
why did they go ?
they did n't go back to the , the old , and , which is that all 24 later -- a new sense of our home that small home and small .
why did they go ? the , they went because president had wanted to show the name that his nation had the better .
but the on words on the university of the university of a .
for was not just a , of was the only the of the east during the cold war .
at the time , this was a feeling about the of the of forces .
it was out to moon because it was something great .
the the - a - a - a - long - of technological .
from the first half of the 20th century , the stopped and the and , and a against a .
in the middle of the century , polio and smallpox .
technology seemed to something that what 's called the a the . "
for the majority of human history , we could n't even faster than a horse or a boat , and a year , the apollo 10 pounds per hour per hour .
since 1970 , there were no human beings on moon .
no one has ever faster than the of the apollo , and the optimism is about the power of technology , because the big problems we 've had to do with mars , clean energy cancer , or the world to the , seem to
i remember as a the of as i as a the .
the of the apollo 17 and saw me , not to very to the the of the the .
i had a idea that this was the last final , but i was going to be that there was still alive in my life .
the the " something with our ability to be big problems with technology to become a .
you hear it everywhere .
we 've heard here in the last two days of ted .
it 's a that when we had us and ourselves themselves with the with the , with things like things and social media and social media , or the , the .
it 's nothing wrong with most of these things .
they have our lives and .
but they do n't solve the big problems of humanity .
what happened ?
there 's a explanation from silicon , where you 've been that in recently , less than companies were more than in years , intel , intel , apple and apple .
in silicon valley , you are markets , in particular , the special of companies , which are the company .
silicon valley says that the are moving from other to ideas , to and even problems .
but this explanation is not good enough .
it explains mainly what does n't silicon .
even their times , they were tiny , tiny , a 10 years within 10 years .
investors had always been to invest in technologies like energy , which is a carbon and its development and , and never ever been the development of the problems without having to value .
no , the reasons why we ca n't solve a big problem , complicated and the .
sometimes we not consciously to not the big problems .
we could fly mars if we want .
nasa has even a plan .
but to go to a decision , public policy , public , and it will never happen to happen .
we 're not going to fly to mars because everybody thinks that there are be the on the earth that are done .
another time we ca n't solve the big problems because our political systems . fail .
today , less than two percent of the earth 's earth from the , sources , like solar wind , wind and less than two percent , and the reason is very .
coal and gas are cheaper than wind and wind and cheaper is cheaper than the .
we all want to alternative , the who can make the , but it 's not .
now , it 's that , and all of all the same opinion of what national policy and international development , for economic , is a economic measure of economic development and development and a price . carbon .
but in the current political climate , there is no hope that the u.s. of the u.s. or the international the international the , and the to be the and .
sometimes are more complex problems that technically that sounds like , not .
it 's been believed that the .
but 30 years research have taught us that political , have impact .
technologies can things like systems like systems and systems and , and it 's going to give a , there are a very governments .
eventually , are going to sometimes solutions because we do n't understand .
president was the war of war , but you discovered what discovered that there are many kinds of cancers , which is of the of the , and only for the last 10 years , is going to be effective .
difficult problems are difficult .
it 's not true that we ca n't solve great problems with technology .
we need to do , but to have to be these four elements all the politicians : politicians and public must be interested in order to solve a problem , institutions need to solve the need to be a problem ; we need to understand it
the the that became a kind of metaphor for the ability to be able to solve the big , to get these criteria .
but this is a model that in future .
it 's not the year .
there 's no battle struggle like the cold war no such as john , who 's all and to a , and not a the like the of the solar system .
but in the , it was just to end up to moon .
he was only three days .
and it 's really that 's really a serious problem .
we are ourselves and the solutions of the future will be to be harder .
god , it does n't be us to challenges .
thank you .
i want to you your eyes .
imagine you 're going to your .
look at the door , their color and the material made it out of them .
now , you a group of the - on their on their .
it 's a the - and - and - and - and - and you and you and you .
you to imagine this .
they 're down , and , and you on .
and then they all directly into your .
bicycles , wheels , all the , and . the in the .
now , the about the threshold of your , or what on the side of your brain , and , how the in the room .
the light seems to the .
it 's you from a of a .
a horse .
you can almost like , by the white of your nose .
you the the that it into the mouth .
go over to him , over in your living .
here you to your .
her clothes just the , she they " the the of a " , " while they on your the .
now , i 'm going to your kitchen .
the floor was replaced by a yellow the , and it made out of a beautiful , the the , the and the of " from the " of " , " , " hand , hand .
okay . now , now the eyes .
i want to tell you about a very competition , year every year in new york city .
it 's called " the . "
a few years ago , i wanted to talk about this of as a the of the and , the of the the of the .
it was a bunch of new and some few of a few of and .
they look at hundreds of hundreds of hundreds of numbers .
the learned of the names of and the of the of
and it whole thing just in minutes .
they were about who the of a of a the at the .
this is crazy .
these people have to have skills .
i started to with some of you .
this is ed , a guy who guy from england , and there 's one of the the .
and i asked him , " ed , when did you notice you this particular ? "
and ed said , " i 'm not a the .
i just have a average memory .
everybody who 's here , you 'll tell you that he or she just has a .
we all , we , techniques , the incredible the of techniques , the techniques that two - two years ago , and the techniques that the used to his , and the of used to books
and i just thought , " wow , how does it have never heard about it ? "
we stood outside out of the the and , this wonderful , brilliant , and funny the english says , me to me , " josh , you 're a american journalist .
you know , you see ? "
i said , " what ? what ? " ? " ? " ? "
" i 'd like to talk to the how to order to order a order of a the of the .
it would be the world prove that this is everybody . "
i told him , " i 'm not listening , but i , but i teach me teach me .
i mean , you 've got to start somewhere , right ?
and that was the beginning of a very interesting journey for me .
so , i 've spent a lot of the next year , i not just to my memory , but also to it and understand how it works , why it does n't work and what could be .
i a lot of people .
this is for example , for example , is example .
he has suffering under suffering and probably the worst memory of the world .
his memory is so that he 's not going to be his . what 's amazing .
although though it was so tragic , he it , it how much our us who we are .
on the other side of the spectrum , i learned to the side of the spectrum .
the the is the .
he was the most beautiful film in the movie film " film . "
we spent a afternoon to the public in lake city .
and i came back to a of flying over the memory , two years ago , and more and more and in the and the were in the .
and i really learned a whole bunch of interesting things .
especially to me that there was a time to the to the to , not nearly as much as
there was a time that people in their memory , it 's the .
over the last few decades , we 've a series of technologies -- from the to the , to the the , the , the , the , the -- it easier to our , the human ability to
these technologies have our to make our modern world , but at the same time .
they 've changed us , and i would argue that they have us to have us .
without the , seems sometimes it seems like we forget how to do this .
one of the last places that earth , you still find people who still , are always passionate and their , and that is unique .
in fact , it 's not unique , there are the like this around the world .
and this was me the i wanted to know how these people do this .
a few years ago , a university at university london a group of the lab .
you wanted to know : is the structure or the of your brains is different than the rest of us ?
the answer was : no .
are you smarter than we ?
she gave them a the and the answer was n't really .
there was a interesting and a interesting difference between the brain of a brain and a and a that was compared .
if you put them into a the and , your brain , as you can imagine , faces and pictures of pictures of you can see that the regions of regions of the brain than the rest of us .
it seems like you 're using the part of your device that uses up using the and used .
why ? and can we learn from learn ?
the to the memory of memory is a by a kind of a - that every year , every year to a new technology to the a more of more and more and more and the rest of the rest .
this is my friend ben the , the .
on the front of him , 36 of the the , he within himself with an hour that he invented and as a single , the .
it 's a similar technology to show the of the in the four of a the in an hour .
yes . yes .
and even though there 's a kind of techniques , to put things in these the , but they all the techniques of the concept , the psychologists called the .
this is so the about this concept , this is a very wonderful thing : follows : if i ask two people , the same word , and i say , " the , " it 's a person called a . "
this is his name .
and i say , " you , there 's a person who 's a . "
now , if i go back to a moment now you back to you , and say , " you the word i 've ever been before you before you ?
you know what you 've done ? "
the person who person the person who is the , remember more likely to remember the word of the word who person who person who person the person .
same word , things the , ; it 's weird .
what is going on ?
well , the name of is means nothing .
he 's absolutely all of all the the that in your head .
but the profession of the , we know the .
so white the .
so , have a on their hands .
so smell when you work from work .
we may even know a .
and when we hear that word first , we this with the word , the word , which it later .
the secret of what going on in the , and the secret to be able to realize things that you can find the of the into the , a that no matter what meaning in meaning in sense in sense ways , meaning
one of the most techniques can two 500 years back to the of .
she was known as the .
and the story of his story : there was a poet called the , who was a the - .
he was a conversation for the conversation , because when you really wanted to really a really big party , you do n't want a the , but a poet .
he 's his poem from the memory and the room , and right in the moment the moment , and the all the all of the and all the .
not only are all dead , your body are to the the .
nobody can tell anyone who was , nobody knows where who has .
the body can not properly .
it 's a tragedy after the other .
the is out outside the of the of this disaster . he 's his eyes and he 's , and he 's that he can see his front eye , where it 's .
and he 's the hand and hand it through the to the .
now , moment , we something that we all know that we do n't know how bad we , or , of our , we have a very good and memory .
i would ask you to ask you to the first 10 words of history of you , you find that difficult to find it hard .
but i bet if i ask you to remember , who remember standing on this moment on a the horse in your horse , your , you might have the .
the idea of the is to create a building of inner eye and it with the of things that -- the , the , the , the , the , the to of it as a memory .
this is a advice that on the over two years old , about the memory .
so how does it work ?
you 're invited to you to talk to ted talk you want to keep it out of the , as it would be done , he would have been the to over two years ago .
you 're like to imagine you imagine you want to imagine your .
imagine a secret crazy and crazy story with the pictures , and to remind you that you first about this about these crazy talks .
and then you put in your house and you the on the back of mr. .
and that would remind you to come back to your friend ed .
and if you look at you , you a , you tell you .
you take into your kitchen , and the fourth thing you should speak to this was the you journey for you for a year , and you 've got some friends who you help you remember you remember .
so , you know , this did n't know their -- not word , word , word , just to say , "
the english term " the , " a theme of sentence , comes from the greek word " the "
these are some of those people when people about and in terms of
the " the first " is actually " first in your "
i was just that i was just fascinating and i 'm still
some of the .
i wanted to write something about this the of the the .
but there was a problem .
the problem that the are the - are - are - are - .
it 's like a group of people who sit sitting there and write a test .
it 's already exciting when somebody who you can .
i 'm journalist i need something to do something about it .
i know that the of things i happen to people , i do n't have access to it .
so if i wanted to tell this story , i had to position .
and so i began to every morning 20 minutes 20 minutes before i started to my newspaper , i was to something .
maybe a poem or maybe a poem or a poem or maybe a poem .
the name from a old the that i bought on the the .
i had to realize that it was a fun .
i could never imagine .
it 's fun because it 's not about to train memory .
you 're better and better and these crazy , and hopefully images of your face .
i 'm at it .
here i am with my the .
some the and a the that were up to two small two of because the greatest enemy of the .
i went to the same conclusion that i had a year earlier , i had a year earlier .
and me , just as a experiment .
it could be a nice - for my .
the problem was that the experiment did n't like .
i won the , which , which really , should n't have should .
it was nice to and , and , but that was n't what i wanted to do .
that 's just tricks .
tricks the work because they work on some simple ideas the of our the .
you do n't need to build a - or - to - to - to - to - to - to - to - to - .
we often talk people with people who are , but it 's a special , but that 's not true .
good are the .
we 're going to better things if we 're .
we remember we 're getting .
we , if we have the possibility of figure out why information and experiences are to us , why they have meaning and , and if we can them into something that we can sense of our senses , and we can call the "
the the , these the , they all .
in fact , it 's not real .
they work because they work us to work .
they 're us to be and , in a way we 're not usually .
but it 's not a shortcuts .
that 's how things to memory .
one thing i want to do with you is i 'm through by the , the man who do n't remember his the , learned , our lives are the of our memories .
how much are we willing to make our daily lives that we our , our , to us , how much are we going to lose , because we are so lazy that we do n't want to keep the and ?
i learned that memory , in any of us , incredible tremendous .
if we want to live a life , we must be the person who do n't know to be .
thank you .
at the age of 27 , i a job in the of the , and i .
i public schools in new york i to for the .
as any teacher i tests and .
i was homework .
the work is the , i grades .
in fact , the was n't the only difference between the best and worst .
the , my 's some of my students were not the .
some of my kids do n't get special good at this .
it 's me .
what you find in the wrong , in , is difficult to do : numbers , the , the of a the .
but not impossible n't these concepts , these n't . i believe that i believe that all my students all the students to learn how to do and hard and hard enough .
after some years , i went to the conclusion , we had a lot of understanding for understanding students and learn from a perspective of motivation , from a psychological perspective .
what we do is that we measure the is the natural , but what if in the and life , life , much more than the ability and easy and learn ?
so i went to the classroom , and i was a to .
i started to kids and in all kinds of all , i always wondered , and i , who is successful and why ?
my , and i went to the west .
we were trying to what would be the , and would n't .
we went to national and , and the would be would be .
we studied the that were worked in very tough in and asked , who were teachers to the of the , and they were able to improve their students of their students .
we were partnerships with our and , who were their to their of their .
and who would make that make money .
in all these different social systems , a is a of a for success .
it was not social intelligence .
it was n't good , physical , it was n't .
it was brilliant .
and is and passion and for very long term .
it is the .
and is when you remember a , not just for a week , a month , but for a , really hard to work to this plan .
you know , is a marathon not a marathon .
i started in public schools in chicago in chicago .
i asked to students of the of the , and they would wait over a year to see who was made .
it turned out that kids with kids are to more difficult to the , even if i can all the properties things like , results , tests , even as they did in school .
so , is not only not just in the and , but also in school , especially for children with children .
the of that topic is me that we know so much that science as little as you how it .
every day , parents and teachers and said , " how do we study the children of children ? "
how did i teach a at ?
how do i do it for ? "
the answer : i do n't know .
what i know is that you do n't know to be a alone .
our data show that a lot of our people are not going to be able to do .
in fact , in is not necessarily not necessarily not necessarily , but even the talent .
so far the best idea that i 've been to the of the , is called the the .
this idea was at stanford of stanford university and the that the ability to learn to learn not to , but they can change their change .
dr. the showed that kids when kids read about the brain and learn how to and how it changes and how to change and , much more likely to do , because they do n't believe that failure is a state condition .
this is a is a great idea for the of .
but we need more .
i want to finish my , we 're already so far .
that 's the work that lies us .
we need to best our best ideas and .
we have to do whether we succeeded , we have to be willing to have to , to have to lessons and from lessons .
in other words , we need to see kids to kids .
thank you .
in the middle of my work is the connection of to our and part of the environment , architecture from the natural , local conditions and traditions .
today , i example , example , i 'm projects .
both of projects are in , in ethiopia and one of tunisia .
they also have common that the different of different perspectives are a part of the brain of architecture .
the first example started with a invitation , a the - in a in - capital in capital .
this is the kind of building that we us , and my team , me as example of what we should be .
first of all i thought i wanted to .
after we saw some of these buildings -- there 's lots of in the city -- we that they have three of features .
first , these are the buildings , they very large very large , people ca n't afford to buy things .
second , you need a lot of energy because the surfaces are the glass , which heat inside , and then you need a lot of the .
in a city where not should happen , because they have pretty the weather that 's been 25 to 20 25 .
and thirdly , their with and do .
this is a place in a place called culture and tradition .
and i also , i was really with our first really of the old market with this old market where people were going to and , and , and , every day , day .
it has also this idea of space that uses the the of to create activity .
so i thought , this is exactly what i really want to design , not a .
but the question was , how we could create a the , building with these principles .
the next challenge came when we were to this , because it 's in a of town of the city , most of the buildings that you were on the picture , not there .
it 's between two that have over hundreds of meters .
first we created a connection between those two streets , and all the of the building .
the is a - the - that creates a that creates that by itself its own shape and its own and rain .
so , we this , we the idea of the with a little with a little that in every , because of the shape of the change .
i also think , how do we like to building the ?
i really wanted to find a solution to the local .
i started thinking about think like a out of concrete in the , which the air , the light , but in the form , but in the form .
and then i this new buttons in the the .
they have the characteristics of a geometry , and that helped me to the entire the .
we 're building this with little , the , that air and light on the way into the buildings .
and that 's what happens by these little , the light out of the light to building the building at the building .
it was n't just the to with ideas with these ideas , because they thought , " this is not a not - . that did n't have . "
but then we realized that this idea is the more of a idea of the idea of a , because they can sell more .
the concept of the was a much , much more . not just because of the material compared of glass , but also because we had no longer conditioning .
so we created some the of that we used to use this project .
the first time was to think about how we could make the building buildings , in a city that has almost every day .
we created a contribution called by on the roof .
and under this , we this as a new public space with space and space , that this .
and these the - on the roof , the water the into the into the .
hopefully , the next year , the next year , because we have the to 5 , and the end of the .
the second example is a - for 2000 in the and in .
so to do a project , project the project i 've ever designed , i had to understand the city of really , but also the environment , the tradition , the culture and the culture .
and during that analysis , i particular on this , the - old structure that was from a wall through 12 through , through the , and by the way .
when i was to the first , the first step to build the existing streets to create the first 12 of with large size and like the and in cities in cities .
so , in addition , we some points in the into the into the concept of this , and they leave with lines , and the changed the pattern .
the final step , about the cell , the cell of the project , as the as , as a part of the .
what was the best in a climate for a apartment ?
this is the , because the of the between the two the that created , and created a natural the .
so we a pattern about the that most of the most that are in
and that 's the result , it 's almost like a combination of a european and the arab city .
there are the blocks with the and there are all these kinds of things .
it also local that , which is higher density to the upper and a lower density in a whole .
it also the concept of the .
the volume has this shape form that has evolved through three different of , and also , into very dense light in the , three different institutions , like a the and a kindergarten and a of the ,
the roof , my the project on this project , the community is the room , the from building .
there can all neighbors and things and make things like a the on the morning , from a building to another building .
these two examples have a common approach of the .
they 're in emerging , where you can see the cities literally .
in cities changes the changes of architecture in the today and future life of people local communities and as the buildings .
and that reason , i think that architecture is very simple , but the solutions that are the relationship between the community and the environment , and the to the and to connect .
thank you .
i want to talk about trust , and i want to talk about the opinions .
they 're so ubiquitous that they grew up to the .
there 's a view of my view .
first of all : trust is a in the , many .
then we need to trust more .
and a task is , we should rebuild the confidence .
i think the goal and the challenge is to wrong on false ideas .
i want to give you a different story about a claim , a goal and a that is a lot better approach to the .
first of the claim : why do people say more ?
and if i really talk to my talk , i know , i do n't know the answer .
maybe it has some in some or , and in some other .
i 'm not going to .
but i course , i can look at the extreme that the are the source of faith that it 's a .
look at a look at a period of a , a lot of a lot of it .
and people will be the people who were 20 years ago , mainly and mainly , and , still .
and the people who was 20 very , very , still very familiar : very , : the , nurses .
we 're other between , and by the way , the average citizens almost in the middle .
but is that a good proof ?
the - -- .
what could you be doing ?
so you look at the general attitude of people when you 're going to be certain questions .
trust politicians ? trust ?
now , if you ask somebody asked , trust , you trust ?
trust it 's ?
trust it 's ?
so , would you probably 'd say , " ? "
and that would be a reaction .
and if you answer the answer , you might say , " i 'm going to some of you , but not . "
it 's rational .
in short , we 're in our short lives , we 're different ways of
we do n't think of that we every or a in a or an institution .
so i could say that i had a particular given , i 'm a , first grade , the first class , i would n't want to make you .
i know , i know that i do n't know that 's not going to be good car .
i 'm that my friend a on , but not n't notice that secret .
simple .
so know how we can from our everyday ways , how different can look , why do we know this knowledge when we think about trust ?
the situation are doing very bad about the actual , because they ignore the sense of the you in the the .
second , we get to .
the goal is to trust more confidence .
honestly , i think i think the is stupid .
i would n't going to be .
i would try to trust the more of the , but not n't .
i 'm not allowed to do it to trust .
and those of you have your into your hands of a certain event , who like the name , made out of the dust , " he 's , " i , i think , i 'm going to trust a lot of trust .
" trust , is not a the goal in this life .
trust and faith and be should be the goal .
and then you say , yes , okay , what is the most important is not , but it .
the people can people .
and to do that , we need to look three things .
are you ? are you ? are you ?
if we can get a person in the topics , and , and , we have a good reason to trust , they 're .
but the person is n't , but it 's probably not .
some of my friends are and , and i would n't want to letter them letter because they 're the .
i have friends that are very in their own , but they 're going to .
and i 'm very happy about that i do n't have a lot of friends that are and , but .
if you have n't , it did n't even have it .
but after that , we 're looking at , then .
trust is the response .
the we need to do that . that 's of course .
over the last decades , we 've been trying to design the - all - all kinds of treatments and experts and experts and that it 's easier to make us .
many of these systems have the effect .
they do n't work like .
a the said once said to me , " the problem is that the longer takes free than the baby to the world .
everywhere in our public lives , our institutions , our institutions , our this problem . this is to and , but to make the opposite .
it 's people like people 's people their tasks , by taking them to .
i can , any of can do any of .
so , that 's what .
the goal is more , and that 's difficult to be if we want to be want to want to communicate and other and other if we want to whether people or politicians , politicians .
it 's not easy . you have to do it . simple reactions or not do n't know .
and now to do task .
this is the to describe the of the , the .
because it suggests that you should trust and i trust .
we can do that for ourselves .
we can go a little bit more .
so , people can improve people to improve their .
but ultimately , it 's a lot of that it 's being done by other .
you ca n't build that again what else are going to give .
you have to give you a give you a confidence .
so you have to be .
and that 's , of course , you do n't usually people to at the nose at the nose .
but they need to have to have older that they are .
how does this ?
this happens every day , everywhere . people do doing , very effective .
here 's a simple example .
the store , i 'm my hate , she put me up and ask them not questions .
you take them back and give me back to me , or a couple of the in the .
this is great . i 'm going you 've been shown to me .
there 's a great morality .
you think of the as vulnerable , it 's a very good sense that you 're you 're you 're you 're to be in your own .
so our goal is not really to very difficult .
it 's relationships between people , and the the , and if the other is .
so the morality of history is much about trust , or about faith , the faith of the or the or the , and much more about and how you people , and evidence of the own .
thank you .
you know , the best thing i 'm most for me is the films i can look .
i love my own my own my with my kids , my daughter , four daughter four years old , we 've together , the of .
the film has n't longer left .
her , of course , was the .
so she had a good excuse , a dress , and a the .
but if you look at that film often , you see , it 's actually he 's actually .
we live in the today and we 're our children in a kind of a big - size .
but " the was by " .
he did n't have this trend .
it has 40 years to continue this trend , -- interestingly -- a different movie , a from a , and a guy with a lot of a girl a girl , and they the the of the .
you know what i 'm talking about , right ?
right .
well , there 's a big difference between these two , even several differences between the of and all the movies that we 're looking like this .
first of all , there are in " the of very violence .
the monkeys are pretty aggressive , as the the .
but i think if the was the by the by government today , now , would have said , " the , " the , you 're the the of that were been the .
use your own shoes to read the computers of the , the evil of evil of the west . "
but it does n't happen .
another point i 'm the most " the by the " is very unique , is that the and are more characters .
this is the first time i was my daughter , star , " star , which was , and was different .
i was also a .
he was at three time old time .
he was n't invited to that he was n't too young .
but he was the second child , and he was less than his sister .
so he 's a , and he the film , he 's a his mother 's mother , and i do n't think he 's understood what he was going on , but he it 's safe in the .
and i wondered what he was doing .
did he think that it 's courage , courage and ?
did he the that a army a army to the government ?
he that there are only in the , and then the , and of course , who is really cool , but during the time , the you with the with a and a the to him the of the ,
compare this with the of " .
how does your the your to a good end ?
by all the the and a the .
this is the kind of world i my children my -- , right ? and not in the world , which are struggling with , which is so much of our world today .
why does it so much -- big -- in the movies that are for our children , and so few the ?
there 's a lot of good about the impact that have on the boys of the boys , and you should read it . it 's very good .
but i did n't read this much lot about boys with this .
i know from a experience that could n't the model that i could use to through the through the world of adults in the girls and girls and common .
i think there was this moment with this first moment with the first kiss when i really expect that the starts , because that ends a movie , right ?
i my mission , i girl the girl .
why do you see there ?
i do n't know what to do .
the movies are very to the and their heart disease , and there are n't a lot of space for other relationships and other .
it does almost like as a young animal , and if you 're a girl , you should better get better the .
there are exceptions , and i 'm going to be the of you .
but they give you a message to the young kids that boys are not the .
they 're real to teach the girls how to the to , but they show the boys not necessarily how they should to the .
there 's no matter for you .
there are also some women who are new stories that are writing to write our and also are still the .
and the most common of all the time , is a classic after the other , and every single one of you , a boy , or a man , or two of men who are friends , or a son and his son , two men who
until you , many of you think -- this year when you finally the movie " the -- the the . "
i recommend him all . he is on the internet .
remember , what the said , "
" oh , i ca n't believe that has made a . "
it 's very good . do n't get it that .
but as no one did n't like this movies , the has the .
i do n't know if you 've heard about it .
it has n't have to that , and meaning , but maybe we 're going to start today .
the is a the and in the middle of the this conversation that she her with a girlfriend of the films of films that had seen .
it 's very simple . there are only three questions that you need to do : there 's more than a character in the movie , which is the , and something ?
try to get that one .
and talk about women in the of the time ?
and what 's their entertainment is something else , than the you like ?
i mean . thank you .
thank you .
two women , the and talk about anything .
this is what happens . i saw it , and yet i see it 's rare in the movies that we know and .
in fact , i went to the week in a to a good movie , " the . "
you remember , a lot of the in the , great the , a general sense of what a good - .
it falls with the through the .
i think that should n't be because of the majority of the -- i do n't know if you 've seen it -- but a lot of the computer plays in a message where men and women are women during the .
there are some good scenes that men in this deep , by the , and the great moment , one of the the , is to go through a door and say , " you go bed ? "
this is some of hollywood .
so let 's look at look at the numbers .
in 2011 , in the 100 of movies , what do you think of how many of these were actually the ?
11 . it 's not a .
it 's not as many of the number of women who we just have congress in congress , so it 's good .
but there 's a number that bigger than this is and that space will be .
last year , the new york times published a published that has government .
you that you 're saying that you .
one of five women in the united states that they 've been sexually .
i do n't think that 's the general of .
i do n't think that the have to do anything .
i do n't think that and directly to do with something , but something more , but i hear this statistics , one of the things i think is a lot of the .
who are these guys ? what are they doing ?
what do you learn to learn ?
take your story , that it 's the task of a male , to prevent the violence with violence and then the , which is a woman who does n't have friends and not talking about it ?
so let 's take this story ?
you know , as a parent that has privilege , a daughter , just like the same of the same thing we do to do this world and these statistics very and we want to .
we 've got to make sure like " the , and we hope hoping that help , but i 'm also going to ask whether is going to be if we 're , at the same time , active or , our , their
the the is a means that we can do something very important and i 'm talking to the .
i think we need to do a very simple idea of the of the .
the definition of the is already changing .
you 've read how the new of the of the and .
they 're going to mess .
our sons will find a way to adapt to a new relationship with and , and i think we really need to show you that a is man who are his sisters and on their side and the really bad guys who are women who
i think we should find the to find movies that the , if we find them , and find the search that are the to the real people , and people and to and to say , and i 'm on side , they
when i met my daughter , who their the in " star wars , " you know what you said ?
the .
the and the .
what have these two common ?
maybe it 's not just the most dress .
i think these two figures are experts .
these are the two characters in the film that know more than others and others know to other people to other people to help them their potential .
and also , they 're leaders .
i like this kind of job for my daughter and i like this kind of job for my son .
i want to do more tasks like this .
i want to tasks what my son said , " and go and " and tasks , which he should be to a team , maybe a team to get to be better and better people , and the of .
thank you .
i want to talk to you about the story of a the .
i do n't know his name , but they but his story .
he lives in a small village in south .
his village lies near .
the drought of the poverty of this village and the the .
there was nothing more there , him , he left his village , and he walked into town city in this case , the , the capital .
when he 's there , there no options , there 's no jobs , no way .
at the end , he 's in a outside of the .
it may not a year , but nothing .
one day , he will be by a man who him lunch , to dinner , for dinner , to the breakfast .
he 's this amazing group of young people and they give him a chance .
he gets a little money to get new clothes and to home money home .
this is him to young this young woman .
he .
he starts a new life .
his life has a sense .
on a beautiful day in the , the , walk into a straight .
this the with was the the and , and group of young people were the to have a with a with .
how could the story of a of that just trying to in the end that he himself in the air ?
he had .
he had an opportunity to focus on the future , and a , and it was the first opportunity to him .
it was the first thing to call him from a state that we call " the . "
and his story is always over again over the areas of the around the world .
it 's the story of the , the , the , in and something different than . "
young people are from the city , from their jobs , jobs , work , but , but young people do n't have a lot of wealth of their cities .
often 's the youth that are under the high - .
2030 , three are three from five to five cities in the last 18 years .
if we do n't young people in the growth of cities , if we do n't give them opportunities , they will be " , the in the , in violence and violence cities .
in my favorite , 70 percent of the young people under unemployment .
70 percent do n't have work , do n't go to school .
they do n't actually do anything .
last month , i went back to the after the , i went to the the , the hospital where i was born .
i remember , i met this hospital , and i asked what if i would never be here ?
what if i was to the same condition of " forced ?
would i be become ?
i 'm not sure what i 'm going to do .
the reason for this was actually a of a of young and leaders .
i 've spent a young of young leaders .
we got together and we a to solutions for the largest challenges of their city .
in the room , a young man , the .
he went to university in university and his .
there was no jobs and no options .
i remember how he told me that he had a the , was frustrated and frustrated , the perfect goal , be member , and other .
they 're people like him .
but this story takes another different .
in the , the largest obstacles are to from to , who streets roads .
23 years , the completely destroyed , so that the best thing is best .
and the the opportunity and they .
he 's a .
he began to stop the the of the that could n't afford to afford .
with his family and his friends , he bought 10 and he and he and he , and he , and he was going to be able to get some of the next three years .
how do this story from the other ?
what makes the difference ?
i think it 's a ability to a new opportunity .
it 's the the , and i think that the the can be the means to be " - . "
it 's the young people in the to create the economic opportunity that they 're so desperately .
you can teach people to be entrepreneurs .
i want to talk to you about a young guy who i one of my favorite : the , a the .
he helped me to bring the most of some of the young people who are at the summit , and to them how to build and .
he 's actually the first the that has been seen since 22 , until before was there , the the that was the by the ship by the , when you wanted to on the wedding of the wedding .
when you ask someone , " when did you last time you ever seen the last time ? " then the answer was the of the that the during the , " never . "
so saw an opportunity .
he was a with a the with .
he was a outside of the , and started to the and the and , to what he could survive in the climate .
he started to take a with flowers , and , and the city around the city , and he was working on the of the first public parks in the last year .
there 's no public parks in the .
he wants to create a place where families and young people are come together and he says , the beautiful things can enjoy .
just 's on the : it does n't have a because they too much .
so the first step is to bring people , and in that room , had a very large impact on the other young people in the room .
they never had really thought about a business .
they thought to work for a work or for government , but that story , its innovation , have a strong impact on them .
he the them to look at their city as a place of view .
he them to be that they can be entrepreneurs , they could change the change .
at the end of the day , they had innovative solutions for some of the greatest challenges of their .
they had the local solutions to local .
the inspiration of young people , and the of a is a really big , but people to their ideas to get their ideas .
they need the and to develop business and develop business .
bring people with people who do need the resources they need , give them the they need to make ideas and they will going to make you for growth .
for me , me , more than me is just a of the a .
it 's about social .
the - selling sell not just flowers .
i think he sells .
his design is " the , " when it created , the view of people to their city .
the has the who help him to and the .
he gave them the chance to get from the state of the the of the . "
these young businesses have a tremendous impact on their cities .
so my suggestion is , you to young people to get more and more often and their innovations and more about flowers and " and "
thank you .
now during my childhood , i was a of my favorite , looking at on the on of the on the on my , parents , happiness . happiness .
but these are hard to find .
they 're from sand , barely .
but after a period of time , i had a .
i began to see shapes , and patterns that helped me .
and that was to find things that i think to a to of and the .
and when i started studying the , i realized that see that my eyes not eyes .
because suddenly , in egypt , my beach in a car of a miles , along the the , and my the grew up to the size of cities .
that led me to use to use .
i had to see differently to see the past in a map .
so i want to show you how we example , if we use .
this is a site that was in eastern called the .
and the appears - brown , we use but we 're , but it 's with color , that 's will be the .
what you see here is the chemical changes of landscape through the and the of the old egyptians .
what i want to share with you today is how we used to have used to make a city of the that the name of the name and for thousands of years .
the was the capital of the old egypt , egypt for more than years , a called the , about years ago .
the is the in the world , and it 's very efficient because it 's in the middle realm of the arts of art , architecture and religion .
and always knew that the of the - somewhere would be the , the , the , the , the red , but in the , this massive .
this area is huge -- it 's the four times four times .
once the , the , the , directly to the the , and , as it moves , and , and towards the west , it 's the city .
so how do you find a city in a .
they 're finding to find that would have to find the needle in the , with eyes and .
so we used to the - to - a map of the landscape of order to see able to see a , changes ,
where the of the used to be used .
but you see , and that 's very interesting , this very bright , with the circle that we can as a possible position for the city .
so we worked with scientists , to the what you see here .
this is like the ice , just instead of the layers , change climate change , you can , your human .
in a depth of five meters , under a layer of south , we found a density layer of the .
that shows that this point position for you can see in five meters , we can find a over several hundred years of carbon , to the to the , rich to the to the , which we the existence of the .
we also found the -- the -- the , the and the -- which shows that a has a .
it might not look at much , but if you look at the the - , which were used by the in the rich , you were just found .
so we found a density layer of the the of on the that on the rich .
we also found a evidence for a the for society , which shows that this is a very important city .
it 's not there , but there 's no the , we will going to take these back to the to a map .
what 's important , we about the young who are trained in the school , so they 're who are going to make great discoveries .
so i wanted to with my of my own the , it was perhaps in the city of the years ago .
" knowledge sharing is the biggest of all the .
there 's nothing in this stuff . "
ted was n't necessarily 1984 .
ideas , but actually , 1984 about a long , long , city , from the .
you can see the on the .
thank you very much .
thank you .
i grew up in taiwan as a daughter of a the , to my beautiful memories , my me to the beauty , the and the form of the chinese .
i was , i was fascinated by this incredible language .
but for a , you seems to as the great wall of china is going to china .
i 've been wondering how i this , so everyone anyone who have to interested in this complex , these understanding and .
i thought that a new way of way to learn chinese .
since five , i learned every single every single every single every single in every single in every single in the .
in the next 15 years , i 've learned new .
we just have five minutes , we have a and very difficult to be very useful .
a chinese the has about 20,000 .
you only need 1,000 thousand for a simple the .
the most 200 you , 40 percent of the simple literature is to understand -- enough to the and the and the of the time .
so today i start with eight to show you how the method works .
are you ready ?
open your mouth as it until it 's .
it will be a " mouth . "
that person goes to a .
" human . "
when the the for fire fires a with " if he looks like , " , " help ! " , and it 's a the of the of the , but i love this idea . you take the best you
this is a tree .
" tree . "
this is a mountain .
the sun is . "
the moon . "
the the for " looks like a from the .
these eight are radical .
they 're the the to create a variety of .
a human .
if someone else is , it means " follow . "
are more , then they read " and " a .
if a human his poor , " says , " it was this big . "
the human being in mouth , it 's like .
he 's a " a , " as the in the whale .
a tree is a tree , two trees are a " . "
three are represent for a " forest . "
and you put a under tree , and you have a " base . "
put a on top of it , it means " the . "
just to remember because is a tree is a pretty the .
remember ? fire ?
two the on the hot . "
three fire together are a lot of " . "
they put the fire under two trees , it 's " . "
for us , the sun is the source of the .
two together are the .
three together are together .
when the sun and the moon , it means , " it 's . "
in the context , it 's be for the next day .
the sun goes across the horizon .
door . a in the door stands the " . "
so you put a mouth in the door , it says , " ask questions . "
the , the . is somebody there ?
this person the from the door . " , " . "
the left is the woman . "
two women are stand for a " . "
now , in three women , this is called " the . "
we have now 30 of .
so with this method , you can put the words in the first eight words .
the next group of eight are up with other words .
so with a little bit of a few hundred , you can learn a hundred of a child - old child .
if we can make these , we start to them it .
for example , it makes a mountain and fire , the , "
we know , japan is the land of the sun .
this is the sun with the " because japan is a of china .
a sun with the is called " the . "
is a human being behind ?
a japanese . "
the white on the are two mountains of the .
in chinese , it 's " chinese , chinese , their political chinese in the dark of the mountains .
today , " . "
a mouth says where it says , " , " . "
that 's the slide that reminds me to leave the stage . thank you very much .
