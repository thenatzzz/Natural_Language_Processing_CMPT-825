when when i was in my 20s , i had my first the . . 
i was a and i was particularly in berkeley . berkeley . 
she was a a woman woman named alex . 
when the came came up the first first , she came up and she a a a , and she fell into the couch in my office , the her her and and told me , about about about . 
and when i heard this , i was was . 
my my , , had a a patient patient for a first patient . 
and i got a woman in the people who wanted to talk about about . 
i 'll leave that , i thought , . 
but i did n't have it . 
with the the stories , that alex opened into the , was easy easy to me just to with with head , while we were the problems . 
" 30 is the new 20 " , " alex , and as far as i did , i had right . 
work came later later , later came later later , later came later later later later came later later . 
people people in the the , and alex , and i did n't have time . 
but soon my my my was , my head , to ask . 
i i was going to . 
i said , " yeah , you know , you 're with with your with your , , you you with a a , but she 's not going to marry . " 
and there said my my , " " , " not yet , but maybe you 'll save the next . 
and also , the best time on the to work before before before they married . " 
this is what psychologists call call a call . 
that was the moment that occurred that i did n't know the new 20 . 
yes , people people later to look at at times as a , , but did n't mean to do the the . 
and so , the alex , the , the , and we got there and and and and we sat them . 
and i realized that this kind of the the the a a problem with real consequences , just just for alex and and their the , but for the , , and , and all the people in the . . 
at that moment , there in the united states , 50 million people in the . . 
we talk about about 15 percent of the population , or 100 percent , if you get to get the without the without without going to go through the . . 
if you guys , if you are in your . . 
i want to show you some of . 
oh , yeah ! you 're all incredible . 
if you work with somebody , the , , , loves , because of the , in the , i 'm going to see you -- -- . . . people in the really are really important . 
my , my my are in people in the , because i think that every single million million should know what psychologists , and and , the the of of the , and most things that you can do for the work for the , for for happiness , perhaps
this is not my opinion . that 's facts . 
we know that 80 percent of the the moments are to to to 35 . 
that means that eight of 10 decisions , , experiences and experiences that make out of your life , make it , , until you 're going to be , , 
do n't you if you 're talking about 40 . 
this group is going to be fine , i think . 
we know that the first 10 years of a a a a a a , and how much money money . 
we know that more than than than half of americans are married or or with the future partner or or partner . 
we know that brain is going to be the second and big big grow in the the and and and for the the , , which means whatever you want to do , you now time to be doing that . 
we know that the the are during during the the , when the , in the , and the the the the women the the of the the and the and the and they to 35 things . 
so in the , , you were the across the body and the the possibilities . 
when we think about the development of a child , we know all know that the first five years for for years and and are in in brain brain . 
it 's the time time the the , , life life a impact impact on the future . 
but we hear about little bit about there there there are something like , and our our are a a time . 
but the people get n't heard in the the . 
the press talking about the the of the . . 
scientists call the the of a a . . 
journalists are the of the people in people in the the like " " or " " " " " " " . " 
that 's true . 
so , as culture , we have the what the decade decade is the the decade . 
the the that that things are a with a plan and a little bit little time . 
is n't that ? 
so what happens when you put someone in the the the head , and say , " you you , you you get 10 years to make a little bit of your life ? 
nothing . 
this person is the the and the and the and it 's not nothing . 
and so every day , , people people in the the or or your your and and and say something like , " i know , my do do n't know , but this relationship is not . i 'm just saying that time . " 
or you say , " all , , as long as i 've done it for 30 years , it 's all all . " 
but later , it sounds like , " my my are almost almost , and i did n't have any . . 
i had a better fortune when i had finished college . " 
and then it sounds like this , in my , , my , like the . 
all the the and and had fun , but then , 30 , the music came out of and and everybody began to . 
i did n't want to be the only ones that i stayed , i i sometimes i i , i my husband , because he was in my my in the . chair . " 
where are the people in the in here ? 
does n't do that . 
ok , that 's 's easy to say , but not does n't make any sense , because it 's about much . 
if a lot of things that the into the , , there 's a enormous pressure to go through a a a , a city , a city , a partner and two or three or three or three or a a lot of time . 
and many of these things are more the and like the , are just showing the the and and and and so all all the time in the . . 
the does does n't mean to buy a red red . 
it means that you want to make the career you want to do . 
you you you you ca n't have this kid , you ca n't want to be able or or ca n't want to be able . 
too many people in the and and and and look at themselves and and myself and and say , " their say , " what did i have ? what did i just thought ? " 
i want to change what what people in in the and doing . 
this is a story that shows how it can . . 
it 's the story of . . 
in my my , when she was 25 , she she she had it had a a . . 
she said she 'd like to work in the art art , or the , but she had n't decided to have , , had had been in the last the last years . 
because the was was , she lived with her friend , who who more more than his his his his . 
and even though their were were were , were their worse were still worse . 
they often often often in the , , but then she would be up and said , " your family could you , you , your friends . " 
one day , came very , and and almost almost all the hour . 
she had bought a and and she and she spent the morning , her her , , but then you look at the the the that the the " , " in in the " in the " 
she was almost the when she came to me and said , " who 's going to be me if i have a accident ? 
who 's going to me me if i have cancer ? " 
in the moment , i had to to to to to say , " i " 
but the no no no no music , really really to look at them . 
a needed a better life , and i knew , was was chance . 
i had had a lot of my my first time to to just how the the the the the in in the . 
and in the next weeks and months months , i 've been three three three to anyone who anyone anyone , whether , or or , or should . 
one of all , i told , she had n't have any , , they would be a a a a a . 
and i i , to to you to something that would be to . 
power to make something that you think about is investment , invest in something you might be . 
i knew knew about about the the , no one knows how the future of work work , but i do n't know , the the . . 
so now , time is this job job , international this job , this this , , which is trying to try . 
i do n't have the the of of the of the but the , that the n't count , , the way , the way . 
this is the . 
i said to to , , , the , but the , but but . 
second , i said , the urban is is is . . 
good friends are are are , to get to to the airport , but , , the people with people who are like to think about how they 're what they what they think they how to they to and how they work . 
this new new new this new person to the the of the outside of outside of the own . 
new things are made of " " " the " , so friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends
it 's true : the half of the is is not or not not not . 
but the other half half is not , and they have the the . 
half of jobs jobs never never have . if if you 're your boss to your neighbors , your your , your job , not a a job . 
this is not a . . so 's how information . 
the last advice : what believed believed you could n't choose the family , but the friends . 
this was for her as her , but as soon as soon as soon as soon as you were to your your own family , if you 're a partner partner and a family family . 
i told her , time , a new family , would be . 
you might think maybe that 's better better than you 're talking to 20 20 or 25 , and i agree to you . 
but the you you you you 're you or you live in your life , if everybody 's facebook on facebook , is not an progress . 
the best time to get your marriage before , before you have a , and that means that the the in the love in love love in love in your . . 
your family family family , means , consciously and the the , what you do , and not , because it works , or anybody with the time that you 're just right . 
so what happened to do ? 
we walked her and and found them the secret of a the who was in in a different state in a museum . 
this weak band to to her , get a work . 
and this gave gave her her her her her her her friend her her her her . 
now , five years later , it 's the for museums . 
she she has a man who she her . 
she loves her new new new and her family family , and she told me a card , which was " " now the the line is " in the , you do n't get enough " 
sounds the sounds sounds like this , it 's all easy , but that 's what i love about . 
it 's so easy to help them . 
in the , like the planes airplanes , the just left the the and and and somewhere to west . 
and after the the , , can make a little difference make the difference whether you 're in or or in in . . 
the equally equally for for , , , or or , , a a conversation , a beautiful beautiful , a a completely a can can have a tremendous impact over years and even across generations generations . 
this is an idea that all all the to that should knows . 
it 's so simple to what i i to to . 
i 've the privilege to do this this as a every day : the the are not the new , , so you you on , you a a , , you use your your own your own family . 
do n't n't tell you what you n't n't , or not . 
your your is now now now . 
thank you very much . 
in the entire industry , it was always our goal to connect the between between and and information information , the gap between our physical world and and the world on the screen where we can our our imagination . 
and this distance is smaller , smaller and smaller smaller smaller , and now it 's smaller than a millimeter that 's a a a a , and computers and for are become for every . . 
but i wondered , how would it be no limit . 
i i looked like what would look like . 
first first i 've this tool tool that i into the digital world , so if you put on on the screen , it it 's the physical physical . . 
designers designers can put their ideas directly into 3d and and surgeons and to to to the at the screen . 
so this tool , the tool was so the . 
but our hands still remain outside the the . 
how can we do with the with the digital information with the digital information and and the the the the of our hands hands ? 
in microsoft , i 've done with my mentor , the the , computer computer computer and a a little room in the keyboard in a keyboard . 
so that that a apple screen and screen and the the the of the fingers and fingers face , and you can put his hands on the keyboard , the the the and the with the hands hands . 
and windows windows and put a position position in the room room , you can just pick it as easy to you a a book from a shelf . 
then you can through through this book and and you and and and and , and all this this , the the of of the the . 
architects can can their their their their hands both their hands hands and and . 
so in these two examples , we 're going to digital digital . 
but how would we take that all the time and the digital information that we us ? 
i 've sure many of you have already already to to articles online online later later . 
but now you have to worry about it . 
here i have a " the . " 
this is the view of you , you a a of your head or a your car , or the your system system the geometry of the body . 
this this idea , i started thinking about it , the idea of the just not just in the space , but it 's but it can make them and and and feel . 
how would a look like a future ? 
in mit media media lab , i 've with my my the the and my collaborators , and i 've been a a . 
now , in this case , this is is is like a tiny - in in our world , which means that computers computers , and people can see this object everywhere , at least small little of these . 
effectively , we have the gravity and and control control the by by magnetic magnetic , , and and these these . . 
by adding the object , , we we it it from the the through the and and time , and it 's possible to move movements movements and and and and and in in the real world . 
so example can can can can be over - visual - , or or the , , or , , and and again in the real world . 
students can use this to use complex concepts of learning and physics physics and and , and a , or a , or a is a a and and experience that experience and and and and it 's very powerful . 
and more than that , just as we we have now in the computer , it 's to imagine how the the of the world is actually transform our daily activity . 
as you can can , , digital will not only not only us us to show us with our interact with our as our part physical physical , , ourselves ourselves of ourselves . 
today , we 've started starting by talking about borders borders , but if we remove the limit , the only frontier is our imagination . 
thank you very much . 
i was been to to for two years to become a the , in china , china , in the 1970s . 
when i was in the first grade , i wanted to get government government to school for school , all the paid paid paid . 
but my mother said , " no . " 
my parents wanted to me to engineer . 
after they they the the , they believed they were that the only way to happiness happiness , and safer , good job . 
it 's not important if i do n't have the job or or . 
but my dream was to be a chinese . . 
i 'm that i i on my my my my . 
a a has to do with a very early way , so i i tried to to try to go to the . . 
i wrote even the the the the and and the to the the of a . 
but the adult does n't give my idea . 
the adults did n't believe it was me to me . 
only my friends had me me , but they were also just as much , as i am myself . 
and with 15 years i knew i was to old to to with with the training . 
so my dream would never be true . 
i was afraid of fear that i could only only could to the rest of my life . 
but that 's so that 's . 
so i had to look at the head , and i could find another . . 
no one there to me me , me well , too well . 
so i i to to . . 
i the my hunger to the the , with a book and a " the the of " i was my my in the , , the the tradition , " " " " " " " " in " the " " " " " " " been inspired
[ " the the " ] " " " " " " " from the the , i came to the united states , and what did i read first ? 
of course , books that are in banned . 
" the good earth " " from life life of the chinese . . 
it 's just not just as propaganda . i understood . 
the bible is interesting , but odd . 
but that 's a subject for another another . 
but the fifth commandment taught me a a of , " " you know your your father and your your your your . " 
" honor " i thought , " that 's so much and much better than " . " 
that was my way to to to and to and to the the and and relationship relationship to my parents . 
through with with a new culture , i started reading the reading . 
this was a whole . . 
for example , i did n't really have a very interesting first , because chinese students are with with this this . 
it never never occurred to me that china does n't have to be in the center of the world . 
so a map tells something about the personal . 
the , the reading is is not new . 
in the academic world , it 's a the . . 
there 's even the like like the the and the the . 
comparison and a a a a a a understanding of a . 
so i thought , if if you read reading reading in the research , why does does n't live in everyday daily ? 
so i began to read two books at the same time . 
you can act of people -- [ " franklin franklin " by the , " john john " david david by david , who was the same same , or or friends with with with with their experiences . 
[ " we " we know , " " " -- " life is a a of of , and , and the stories of the , , , in the , , joseph , joseph " joseph " ] and and and and , had to had to .
in were in the , the the the , the political and political nature . 
they were all they were all nature , , , , and social -- -- interesting . 
if you make a a , , it it fun to read the the to read two languages . 
[ " the " for a " " the " " the the of the water -- the the of of " " " " " " " " instead of me me in translation , i i figured how much i i can . 
i 'm , by by , i think , " happiness " happiness " " " " " " joy " " 
" " " in " in means " new mother " . " 
books books for me , a a a , , through , and i 've got a connection to the people and the present . 
i know that i never never feel , or i 'm feeling . 
a dream dream dream is really really nothing compared to what many many other . 
i came to come to that that it 's not the only purpose of a true . true . 
his purpose purpose is is to to us to get to to where dreams dreams , where our passion and our happiness . 
even a dream dream dream can can this purpose . 
because of , i 'm here today , happy , happy with a with a purpose in life and with a lot of time time . 
you books always be with with you . 
thank you very much . 
thank you very much . 
thank you very much . 
when i was eight years old , a new girl was in the class , and she was so amazing , as as girls as girls . 
she had had a hair hair and and a little the the , was was in in and and . 
i was in in , i i until i had a a plan plan . 
so i stayed a little bit longer , school , and i was in the the . 
when the air was was , i came into , i went into into the classroom , i took the the of the the . . 
and then i did . 
i the the notes of my the , just just some some few . 
all the the . 
when when i wanted to make the book , i noticed that some of my other had had to be pretty good . 
so i i in the all of the , , , no . 
i gave all all of all , and i myself myself , because i was because i was also all the time . 
i 'm still more more about my behavior . 
i do n't understand where the thought came came . 
i do n't understand why i did so good . 
i felt really good . 
i do n't even know why i never never been to . 
it was so obvious . 
i was never caught . 
but most of me , , , why why it so so that that little little girl was in the ? 
i 'm not happy . 
it 's so so , , , . 
we know that babies are under under suffering . 
similarly , primates . the are inherently from nature . 
we know that the the of the is among among among among in in the united states . 
but i never never a study study that i could their their or or their their or their . 
so , to to , to to , to the literature , because because novel is the lab that the the in in the in the all possible forms . 
is it a to say that if we did n't have any , we did n't have no literature ? 
so no do n't have a the , , " no " . " 
no the king king , not " the " . " 
no shakespeare . 
because , as the the of the the , , we , " and " and and " " " the " " " " " " " " " " the " " " the . " 
no no , no , no , . i know that it 's in to say that the has the answer everything has , but in in the , he has really really it . 
this year , we this this , the the , the the of " the " for " for the time time , and his analysis analysis analysis the the to the the and and the the , and my thing that we have hope hope . 
think think think think think think , think , think , right ? 
we think of the little boy that 's trying to sleep . 
we think thinking about a piece of cake , in the . . 
we forget how the his vision was . 
we forget how the it is . 
these are books are the the of the like the . 
i do n't know how the is , but but we say , he 's . 
let 's look at the why the novel and the the that the the and and and so well . 
is it so obvious that that that drive is -- -- -- , , , such a a basis for a story ? 
i do n't know . i think it 's just hard to the the , because think think what happens when we 're . . 
when we 're at the , we tell ourselves a story . 
tell us stories stories about the lives of the other people and make it that it 's us bad because they 're so bad that it 's us . 
as a , of the history , and the audience we know what the detail has to to to to the the into the the . . 
the way to make us all to us , and , and , and , and . 
in the first band , " in in the world , , , , one of the great , , about about his and , , , so , , as they as they and and and , " wait , " i i love love woman , someone else
everything you give me and and me me joy , might might be happy to joy , even even in this moment . " 
this is the story that he tells telling , and from there to the to the that that he 's a new , he 's in the his of his his , his his his his his in his private the . 
we 've got to admit that the and the are the . 
and friends friends have have to leave the country if they want to to with him to him . 
but you do n't need to be to to , to realize that it 's hard hard . right ? 
there 's a . . 
it 's a a feeling that 's to be . . 
what do the the ? 
it 's like information . 
i want to . 
the , the the of brown hair and little little . . 
i want to get photos . 
so 's why it 's so successful . 
basically , the language of science and science and the . 
when when these the the , , suddenly suddenly the the door , the the of the , and he the his his his his , , he he this behavior . 
he says , " you think you 'll be that 's a , but it 's not nothing to to a text text text , or a text text , or a a . " 
he says , " there 's scientific scientific worth worth value . " 
and what 's trying to show us is that the is is and and makes us look look at the core of her , , and for the truth , the truth truth , and the truth , the the , , the better , the better . 
in , , , , , , that 's for the way to wisdom wisdom . 
he says , " a woman that we need to suffer us us , , us us us a greater and and more more complex more feelings than the genius of a man who 's interested . " 
he tells us about about that we should make women women ? 
no . i think he 's us to say that he tells us us to tell us about ourselves . 
is there another different sense that we us in this particular way ? 
even though we feel feel our our our our our our our our hidden and our our and and ? 
and we , we do n't feel different with with different kinds of sound ? 
freud , later , write . 
one day was was a by a very young man who was who was the by the thought of his wife , his wife . 
and freud says , this man is kind of strange , because he does n't even know what his wife does . 
because she 's innocent , and everybody knows that . 
the poor creature is lower under the . 
instead , he he looking for his his his his , without it , , so , behavior . 
she she too too , she she to with with a man ? 
[ freud ] says that the man is the the of the the of his wife . 
the novel is very good at this point . 
the novel describes very well , how much hard us us , , , but not not . 
because the more we are , the more we we us to . 
so i think that way that we do n't get to do to do things or illegal . 
i 'm to to be very . . 
and i think about about eight years , but i think also the story i i 've heard in the news . 
a woman woman from michigan was written , she because she was designed by a self - the the , , the news for himself . 
a whole year . 
they tried to get the new friend of her shoes into the shoes and i i to when i heard the , , i was with . . 
because ... let 's be honest . 
what does it mean , if creativity , creativity , right ? 
this is something a novel novel . 
this is something from a novel novel the . 
the is one of my favorite . . 
she 's the most the and most woman woman american american . 
from her , " two two in the train , and the the mr. mr. , , " books books how to -- to keep your mind , and we 're in the the realm of the that the in between the in the the and what might be be
take a the , , your your character . 
first , all , tom tom , they have got to have , and they have , and he and what they had once , and they they like , and it 's , by the , , and he name on their name , he 's their their .
this is a way . 
but what do we do ? we ca n't make it as as tom . 
i ca n't give the the world anywhere , even though i 'd like to make it on some days . 
it 's a shame , because we live in a a time . 
we live in a " - time era . time . 
we are all good social social social media that are are currency , right ? 
does the novel of the ? ? i 'm not sure . 
but we do what what do do when you 're not safe if you 're in a a . 
let 's go back to the street and ask questions to the the . 
think of think about think think about think about the , as a professor professor professor professor professor , this this great . . 
but i liked to the the , the boss of the the with the face of a rat , the the needs , needs , the the genius , it 's him to . 
that 's me familiar . 
so , needs needs his help , help him him and the and the stories of stories stories . 
but when you start to start starting to start something , and eventually in the " six six , " and , and all of his solution , , , is the to to and and say , " we 're not the on them , mr. the . 
we are proud proud . them . " 
and he 's that that there 's no no to to the the , the would not n't shake the shake shake . 
that 's one of the few times that we can see the in in the stories , and i think this little little very smart , but also 's a . 
it seems like that 's not an emotional , , but a problem . 
in a moment , it 's a moment on a different different of like . . 
and in the next moment , they 're on on an wavelength . 
suddenly , it 's to to this this , he he has him . 
is it really easy ? 
what if if if if a really a problem problem ? if it just about how we deal with the other relationship ? " 
maybe we would n't be to be the on the . . 
we could could make us . . 
but i like the . 
while we 're waiting for , , we still still the literature as a . . 
literature alone , the the . 
literature alone , she can the , , . 
and who 's all the : the good news , the the tom tom , the crazy the , the the , the the . 
we are in society society . 
thank you very much . 
i was about 10 years old and on a the - old with my father in my father , a the in the northern of of the new york . 
it was a great day . 
the forest forest . 
the sun would look at the petals like the glass like glass , and if if you have no path , you would have almost almost that we were going to be the first people who are going through this forest . 
we came to our our . . 
i saw the little hut on a cliff and and across a the , beautiful , , as something called something . . 
behind the roof , a one , , , , four square , , with the , the , the the and a old the . 
i was amazed , i was angry and confused . 
the were were were were lazy to to the , what they had had -- -- who were , would they would to to ? 
the question was asked me , and i asked them to them : 
who who are we going to 
how do you also or or where where " " might be , who are behind us behind us in istanbul ? 
who are a behind us behind rio in or or in paris ? 
here in new york new york , the the the of every day of day was tons and tons tons tons tons . 
i wanted to to them -- as individuals . 
i wanted to understand who make the job . 
how is it be wearing a uniform and wearing wearing ? 
so i started a with a . 
i drove the the the , , the and and and and went to to and and and and in the city , and i was a lot of , but i was still a . 
i have to go deeper deeper . 
so i took a job job as a . . 
i did not just working with the truck . i was the the . 
and i was the the mechanical the and and the snow snow snow snow . 
it was a remarkable privilege and and a a experience . 
everybody asks after the . . 
he 's there , but not as the as you think , and days days , it 's really bad , you 're pretty quickly . 
and you you to the weight , you you just hard . 
i know people who who were this this year , and , and their body still still weight weight weight weight weight weight their body , to tons of every . 
and then there 's the danger . 
after statistics of the the , , the the in the under the the among the the the country in the country . and why i learned why . 
you 're all the entire day in traffic , all over the . 
everybody wants to and and often often do n't have to be . . 
that 's really bad for the workers . 
and the garbage itself is full of the that the from the the the and terrible . . 
i learned also about the the of the . . 
if you look from the the , and from the back of the city of a city , you can see that the is is a a . 
he does n't stop to . 
it 's also like a kind of a or or a . . 
he has to be in movement . 
and then there 's the stigma . 
you put the uniform uniform and and , , somebody -- whatever -- whatever -- you you get your traffic or your or or you 're going to close to your apartment , or you can your coffee your your your your and and and and you and say you
i think this particular particular particular because because i believe in the the the of the the the the the most important city on the streets of the city . that 's three reasons . 
they 're the the of the health health . 
if you do n't waste the waste , every day and efficient and it would take the the of the and and the the and and the would would give us on very very . 
diseases that we 've been achieved for decades and and , , and would spread and us . 
the economy takes it . 
if we ca n't do the old stuff , we do n't have a place for the new , and the motors of the the to start to the , the is the is the . 
i do n't not know the capitalism , i just just the the . . 
and then that 's what i call our our , , , , , , . 
and i mean , just as fast , we 're now , movement . 
we do n't care about ourselves , our our , our our or our our our , , or , or . 
we take them , throw them away , forget , because we know that people on people on the other side , are taking care about . 
so , i want to to today today some ways of how we think about how to think about how to improve the and and and them them into those entertainment how you create a city that are sustainable and and . 
your work , i think , is kind of the . 
you see the streets every day , regularly . 
they carry in many many cities . 
you know when you can expect it . 
and your work does our our . 
they 're like a a . . 
the the that you 're , , us us to imagine ourselves before our our , , the , and and and we have to be more to to every price . 
on days after 9/11 , 2001 , i took the the of a the on the street , and my son and son and and the and and there was a man who drove his his , he was doing it . 
and i tried to him him for him work -- -- all day days , but i started to cry . 
and he looked at me and and just looked and and said , " everything 's fine . " 
" everything is fine . " 
it was n't until later started i started my research and the the the . 
his name is the , and we worked together , and we finally got good friends . 
i wanted to believe that the had right . 
everything is fine . 
but in our efforts , change the way we we on this planet as a planet , we need to look at the cost of the cost , including the very very cost of the work . 
and we have to be informed to help people who do this work , how we think about how to create systems about , which is a of of the last 40 years and the world , and to us to a species of waste species that are can be
the , , we think when we talk about about , , three percent of the national national national . . 
it 's a remarkable statistic . 
in your daily , in your lifetime , if you see next next to see somebody next whose whose job is to make them behind , they take a moment time you 're . 
take a moment to get to . 
hello , hi , what goes ? 
that 's not enough . 
hello , hi , what goes ? 
my name is the the , and i 'm not drunk , but the doctor in my birth . 
he 's six my six six six six six six and and and and my little little , and the air .

i love the fact that my favorite and and my have have have the same . . 
and , , i love the fact that i could go home from my home to new york city if i wanted to . 
many people do n't run with hot , but my parents not n't not to " a " . " 
the mantra was my : " yes , you can can . can can . " 
so if if my three older sisters sisters , i , i i with mit . 
when my three older sisters sisters down to school , my parents parents to , , so i could go , and if we were not all the , , , we all all the the the my mother 's mother . 
my dad taught me to walk when i was five , he he my my feet on his feet feet and just just the . 
another one was his was was a a a camera of my my front of my my , so i i to to you . 
my my was was was very strong , and so -- -- so , in the first day in the kindergarten , i was like a a a who had a a to a . 
there was only only six in my city , and my were were my family . 
today , we have 20 20 in the city , and they 're still all my family . 
i think nobody has ever noticed that we do not have a . . 
it was before before , and before before before it took for the , , " " i hate to use " as " " 
the people i grew up with did n't have with with my faith . 
but they were very worried that i could possibly to maybe maybe . 
and i explained to tell you that i was going to live three entire three three entire life , so , from the to the to the . 
i have the the . . 
yes , on , it 's crazy . 
my parents could n't afford afford to afford , , so they sent me to to the . . 
i learned how to make on on , , so i can walk on . 
and i 'm from the , where it 's really important to be , , so if my my , my , , then i also . 
and if my friends friends their the coast of the coast of the , i do n't . 
i spent my summer in a summer because because my parents were afraid that we if we go to to every single summer , one day , day . 
the the the often that that my dad wanted to to me , so i used to milk of the , , , and into the dead sea , and i know how the water in the eyes and i thought , " it worked ! it worked ! "
but we found a a , , : : . 
i have to say it 's really boring , but before i did , i i i a a a , a , a not a n't even . . 
now now i can stand on on the head . 
my parents always always me me that i would be able to make sure that not was not impossible impossible , and my dream was was to be the the general general general general . " 
because of , , i got a great scholarship on the the , the who 's the state state , because i 'm every of of . 
i was kind of the the the of the . . 
all all me . 
i do n't like all of the homework , so so , , , all of all of my , , , getting in all all of these . . 
every time i i a a from the " the , , , my my teacher . 
but i never got a role . 
in my , , , the the , the , the piece of piece of the " " dance , " dance dance , 
a piece of a a girl with . 
i was a girl with . . 
so i i everywhere , , " finally , i get a role !

finally finally ! 
thank god , thank you , i 'm free free ! " 
i did n't have the role . 
the brown brown had got the role . 
i was the to the the of the , , i i the , when someone had my cat cat , and she asked why she said me , she told me that i would n't going to do the . . 
i said , " sorry , but if i ca n't , if you ca n't , the character ca n't . " 
i was born for this role , and she gave them a a without a . . 
college the life life . 
hollywood is known known to physically physically healthy healthy . . 
after after i graduated , i was my role role as a the in a . . 
my dream was true . 
and i knew that i was soon to " the " " " " " 
but instead , i stayed a the the that was just the the the , and i realized realized that the did n't have a , , , , , , , . 
they just only perfect perfect people . 
but , you know , the the . 
i grew up with the the , the the and the , and all of these women had a common common : they were the . 
so i became a . . 
my first job was to to , new york city city new york city new york , and i 'm never going the the of the first the that i ever stopped , forget him , in new york to new jersey with a with a with a . 
i was in in in in the united states , the united states , i 've also been the the the east in arabic , the and the . 
some people say , i 'm the first - in in the arab world . 
i do n't want to ask the first , but i know that you know , you know , never heard of the bad little bit that women women are not not , and they find us to . 
2003 , my brother brother from a mother and father , father , the , and i was the new yorker new american american american the that that now now have to be the . 
our goal was to to to the the negative image of americans from in to change the media and and to to the , that the and and and not . 
the the of the was much much much much than the challenge challenge challenge against the stigma of disability . 
my my breakthrough breakthrough was 2010 . 
i was been to to the the in the the " the " " the " . 
i was like to the the the , , , and she 'd me into a studio and and i sat on a chair chair . 
so i looked at the the looked at and and said , " sorry , i i get a different chair ? " 
and she looked at me and and she said , " five , four , three , two ... " 
and we were live ! live ! 
so i had to go on the table of the , so i did n't get out of the screen , the when the was was after me , i was . 
there was my opportunity , and i had her , , and i knew that i never never back . 
but mr. mr. the did not me me me , but , but made me a a and and my my my chair . 
and working with the i 've been working with a i 've learned learned something like all the internet internet . 
people say , kids are , , but as a child or adults , or never never been me me . 
in the world wide web , i am talking about my disability of the . 
when i look at online online , i see like like , " the , why why why why why ? " 
" the , is the the ? " 
and my favorite : " the the . 
did it have ? 
we should be for them . " 
even even , , my disability into the the , : the , the , the . 
a disability is such as as . 
if a ca ca n't play play play , ca n't play play play . 
the are are the biggest -- yes . that 's a worth value . 
people are religious are the largest minority in the world , and we are the the in the the . . 
the doctors said , " i never never walk , but i 'm sitting here here . 
but i would be with social media , i would n't be here . 
i hope that we can make a a picture of of in in the media and and create . 
maybe there 's no way to the the internet when the more difficult to be more positive . 
or maybe not . 
maybe it 's still a village to do a child . 
my journey journey has been me to me a very few places . 
i put on the red red next next to red the and and the the the . . 
i i was working in a film with a the and and with with my my , , with amazing , , . 
i 'm as a the with the the " the the - the - . 
i was a the - in the new new york city in the national national center . 
i 've been a the 's " , , a a , who 's trying to give the to to the chance of a chance that my parents my me . 
but the one that moment that most most -- before before -- this -- the the , when i first the the the the how the a a and how a bee bee , the the has the way and the way that i do n't . 
this was the only time that my father ever ever seen a the of of and i and i was going to talk to this presentation . 
: god god your your soul , your dad , dad . my name is the the , " if i can can , you can can . " 
there was a time where we 're big big . . 
on the 21st , july , , , the the the the from the the apollo apollo and and , and , and the , the the of the ocean . 
armstrong and the were alone , but her her on the the of the the was the the of of a the , , , . 
the the was was the largest largest largest in in history history of the united states of america . 
to to to the moon , it 's about about billion billion dollars worth of worth , , four or four percent of the . . 
apollo created created for 400,000 people and and the the collaboration of companies companies universities universities . 
people died , including the of the apollo . 
but until the end of the end , 24 people people to the moon . 
from the the that are its surface , it 's after death , the last year , now the oldest . 
why did they go ? 
they did n't go back to look at the old and and and something that all the 24 later -- a new sense of that that our home is small and small . 
why did they go ? the , they , because president president wanted to show the to the his his his had the better . . 
but the on words words on a university of the university of a . 
for the , , was was just just an victory of the the across the east during the cold war . 
at the time , this was a feeling feeling feeling feeling about the the of of the technology . 
it was a to the moon because it was something great . 
the the - a - a - a - long - century series of technological . . 
from the first half of the 20th century , the the and the and the and , and a vaccine against against . . 
the middle in the middle century polio and smallpox eradicated . 
technology seemed to to something about what 's called a the the a " the . " 
for most of the human history , we could n't even faster than a horse or a a boat with a , , but in the year , the apollo was 10 10 miles per hour per hour . 
since 1970 1970 , no human have been on on the moon . 
no one has ever faster faster than the the of apollo apollo , and the optimism optimism is about the power of technology , and we 've had to technology technology to to clean clean clean energy , or to save the world 's hunger , seem to seem to
i remember remember as a the , , i i as a 
the the of the apollo 17 , and my mother me me me , not too to the very the the . 
i had a idea that was the last last , but i was sure that i was going to be in in my life life . 
the the the " something something with our ability to deal with big problems with technology , become a . 
you hear it everywhere . 
we 've it in the last two days days . ted . 
it 's a that that if us had us to and and and ourselves themselves with with with , with with things like things and and and and and social media and social media , or algorithms , the . 
it 's nothing wrong wrong with the of these things . 
they have our our lives and and . . 
but they do n't solve the big problems of humanity . 
what happened ? 
there 's a a explanation explanation silicon silicon silicon silicon where where you 've been that in in recently , we 've been doing more than than in the years , intel intel , microsoft , apple apple and apple . 
in silicon valley valley , you are used to be , in particular , the the , the company companies . 
silicon valley says that that that of of have gone to to lead to to the ideas , and and , and problems problems problems problems . 
but this explanation is not not enough enough . 
it explains mainly what does n't silicon with silicon . 
even even their their times times small times small , tiny , , 10 years ago , a a 10 years 10 years . 
investors had always been thinking of energy technologies in technologies like energy energy that are a a and and development development and and , never never never never never ever been the the development of the problems problems without having to value . 
no , the reasons reasons why we ca n't solve a problem , , complicated complicated and more . . 
sometimes we decide not to to the big problems . 
we could fly to mars mars , if we want . 
nasa , even has a plan . 
but to to , a political policy would be public public public public , and so it 's never going to happen to 
we 're not going to fly to mars because everybody thinks that there are be done on the earth 's stuff that have to be done . 
another time we ca n't solve the big problems because because our political systems are fail . 
today , less than two percent of the earth 's earth , from sources sources , solar wind wind wind wind , wind and wind , less than two percent , and the reason is is very small . 
coal and gas are cheaper than solar wind wind wind and wind and efficient is cheaper than the . 
we all want to alternative alternative that can keep the the , but it 's no . . 
now it 's so , , , and and and and all of all the the same opinion of what national national and international international development , to : : mainly a lot of economic development in the development and development and and and and a price of carbon .
but in the current political climate , there is no hope that the u.s. of the u.s. or or the international the international the these the and and and . 
sometimes are problems problems problems that sounds like , , not not . 
it 's been believed that that the is going on the . 
but 30 years of research have taught us that political political political political impact impact impact impact . 
technologies technologies can things like like like or systems systems systems systems like systems and and and and , and , but it 's going to be a , , there are no governments . 
eventually , , large problems sometimes the solutions solutions because we do n't understand understand the problem . 
president , the was told the war war war war , but you discovered discovered that there were many of of of the that are of of of against therapy , and only only years , , , , , be be in the . 
difficult problems are difficult . 
it 's not true that we ca n't solve the problems with with technology . 
we can , we have to to , to have these four elements , : politicians politicians and politicians must be interested in order to solve a problem , institutions needs to solve it ; it needs to be a problem problem . and we have to understand it .
the the that led to a a metaphor metaphor for the ability to be able to solve the big , , to these things . 
but this is a model which ca n't happen in the future . 
it 's not the year . 
there 's no the struggle like the cold war , no politicians like john 's , , everything everything and and and and to to a a power , and no sense of the like the the of the solar system . 
but in the , it was was just end to to moon moon . 
he was only three days . 
and it 's really that whether it 's really a serious problem . 
we are ourselves ourselves and the solutions solutions the future will be to be . 
god god , it does n't be us to challenges . 
thank you very much . 
i want to to you you your eyes . 
imagine you you you 're going to your your . 
look at the door , their color and the material made made of it . 
now , you a a group of the - on on their front . 
it 's a the - and - and - and - and - and and and you to your your and your your . 
you you to to this . 
they 're the down , and and and directly directly on . 
and then they all all directly directly into your . . 
bicycles , , wheels , all the cross and the , and the the in in the . . 
now , you have the the in your your your your your your your your your your , or what 's on on the side side of your brain , and , , how the the in the room .

now , i 'm going to look at your kitchen . 
the soil was replaced by a yellow the , and it 's made a the , , the the , the the , and the the of " from the " , " " , " , " hand , hand . 
okay . now , open eyes . 
i want to tell you about a very competition competition , year in the new york in new york city . 
it 's called " the the the . . 
a few years ago , i wanted to to know about this as a the as a the and and the who who the the the of the . 
it was a bunch of new and some few of , and very different and and . 
they they 're looking at hundreds of hundreds hundreds hundreds of numbers numbers numbers numbers numbers numbers . 
the learned that the names of of and and the of the of of of of 
and it whole whole thing in just a few minutes . 
they were the about who who the the of a a of a the - the . 
that 's crazy . 
these people have have have have skills skills . 
i i started to talk to some of them . 
this is ed , , a guy who was out of england and and there 's one of the the the . 
and i asked him , " ed , when did you notice you you have this particular ? " " 
and ed said , " i 'm not a the . . 
i just have a average memory . 
everybody who 's going to tell you that he or she 's just a a . . 
we 've all all , we , techniques , , , , to these incredible techniques , , , which is the the two two years ago , the same techniques that used to to to his to and to the the to to to books books books . 
and i just , " wow , how does it have never heard of it ? " 
we stood outside out of the the and and , , this wonderful , brilliant , and , funny , english says , me to me , " josh , you 're a american journalist . 
you know , you ? " 
i said , " what ? ? ? ? " ? " ? " ? " 
" i 'd like to teach the the of how to get a order of a the - the . . 
it would be the world prove that everybody can be here . " 
i told him , " i 'm not not , but i but i would teach you teach . 
i mean , you 've got to start somewhere somewhere , right ? " 
and that was the beginning of a very interesting journey for me . 
i 've spent a lot of the next year , i spent not just to to my my memory , but also it it , and to understand it , how it works , why it does n't work and be its potential . 
i have a lot of people interesting people . 
so here 's the example , for example , , for example , 
he 's suffering under the , and probably the worst memory of the world . 
his memory is so bad that he 's not going to be his his . . 
although though it was so tragic , he he it in the way how our memory our us to who we are . 
on the other side of the spectrum , i learned to to the the side of the spectrum . 
the the . 
he was the most of the the character in the movie " " " . " 
we spent a afternoon to the public public public in in lake city . . 
and i came back to to a a whole pile of the memory , which was two years ago , and in and in the in the and and later in the . . 
and i 've got a whole bunch of interesting things . 
and especially me , there was a time to to the the to to the the , , , not nearly as much as the as today . 
there was a time when people were in their memory , it 's a . 
over the last few decades , we 've a series of technologies -- from the to the , to the the , the , , the computer , the smartphone -- the it -- it it makes us easier to our our , , , , human ability to 
these technologies have have our modern world , but we us at the same time . 
they 've us us to us us and and i would argue that they have have us to have . 
without the need to , seems sometimes , as we as we forget . 
one of the last places of the earth , you find still find people who still still are passionate , their , , , , and , , and that is this unique unique . 
in fact , he 's not unique , there are the like this around the world . 
and this has me me the the the , i wanted to know how these guys do this . 
a few years ago , a university university at university university london london group of a brought into the lab . 
they wanted to know : is the structure or the of their brains differently than the rest rest rest rest of us ? 
the answer was : no . 
are you smarter smarter we we ? 
she gave them a a the , and the answer was : actually did n't . 
there was a interesting interesting interesting and a interesting difference between the brain and a the a brain and a a a that was compared . 
if you put them into a a , and your brain , , as you grow , faces and pictures pictures pictures of you can see that the the regions of regions regions regions of the brain than the rest of us . 
it seems like they 're using the part of your device using using for the and and using . 
why ? and can we learn from something ? 
the the to the the memory of a kind of a - state , every year , every year , with a new technology to the to to the more more of more and and the rest of the rest . 
this is my friend ben the the , the the . 
on the table , front of him , 36 of the the , he he he himself himself within an hour with an technology that he invented and and as a . 
it 's a a technology technology around the the of of the in order of 140 , the , in a half an hour . 
yes . yes . 
and even though it 's a a of techniques techniques techniques to put things together in these the the , , but they all created the techniques on the concept that psychologists called the the . 
this so so - the - this particular concept , this is : how follows : if i look at two to the the same word , and you say , " " you you saying that there 's a person called " . . " 
this is his name . 
and i say , " " you know , there 's a person who 's a . . " 
now , when i go back to a now , you back , and say , " you know , i mean , the word i 've ever been before you before some time ago ? 
you know what you 've got it ? " 
the person person who person the person who is called , , , with to think of probability , the word that person person who person the person person who person the person . 
same word , things the , ; it 's strange . 
what 's going on here ? 
well , the name of the means . 
he 's absolutely all of all the the that that in in your head . 
but the profession of the , we know what we know . 
so white white white white the . 
so , have a new on their hands . 
so smell smell , when you come home from home . 
maybe we may even know a a . 
and when we hear that word first , we 've got this whole with with the word and the it it it later that later . 
the secret of what going on in the front of the , and to to be able to look better at the way to to the the of the into the into a , -- a that that no matter in meaning in meaning in a sense way , meaning
one one of the techniques techniques can do two 500 500 500 years back to the . 
she was known as the known . . 
the story of his story is : : there was a poet called the who who a a the . . 
he was the for the conversation , because , when when you were a really big , , you would n't want to be a , , but a a . 
he 's his his poem from the front and and the the the room , and the moment moment the moment came up with the and and all all the . 
not only are all dead , your body are to to the to the . . 
nobody one can tell anyone who was , nobody knows where who is . 
the body can not be properly . 
it 's an tragedy after the other . 
the 's outside , the only way of this this -- it 's his his eyes and suddenly he 's he that he 's going front of his eye eye , where where where where where where where where . 
and so he 's the the the hand , and it causes it to the the . 
now , moment , moment , something that we all know that we do n't matter how bad we we , , , , , , , , , of our colleagues , we we have a very good and and and memory . 
i would like to ask you to first the first 10 words of the story about the , so you find it hard to find it hard . 
but i bet bet if i ask you to remember , who remember standing in this moment on a horse horse horse horse horse in your horse , your , , then you might have the the . . 
the idea of the is is to create a building and and a and and it it with with the images of the things -- the dark , the , the , the , the , , the , of the as it 's to . 
this is a high - based that on over 2,000 over 1,000 years old , , about memory . 
so how does it work ? 
you you 're invited to to talk to you about ted talk and you you keep it out of memory , as it would would be done , he would have been the to over two years ago . 
you 're just like this : imagine you you your your your . 
imagine a secret crazy and and crazy story with a wonderful pictures , and remind you that you first first to about about these these crazy talks . 
and then you put in your house and you the the the on the back of mr. . . 
and that would remind you to start your friend ed . 
and if you look at the , you you you to a a a , you you tell you . 
you put into your kitchen , and the fourth thing you you to talk about was the strange journey that you for a year . and you 've got friends friends you to remember you remember you remember you remember . 
so , this research , , it did n't know -- not word for word , word , , , , , but to topic . 
the english term " the the , " a theme theme of , comes from the greek word " " " " " " 
these are some of those people when people about about and and and and in in terms of . 
the the " " " " " " " " " " first " in first " in your " " 
i i was just this , and i 'm still , and and and i 'm still 
some of the other 's risks . 
i wanted to maybe something something about this the of of the the . 
but there was a problem . 
the problem that the are the are are are are . . 
it 's like a group of people who sit sitting there , and write a test . 
it 's already exciting if somebody 's the . 
i 'm journalist journalist , i need something to do something about it . 
i know that the the things that i think about the people in the people , but i do n't have access to it . 
so if i wanted to tell this story , i had to to to position . 
and so i began to every morning every 20 minutes 20 minutes before i started with my newspaper , i was something something about something . 
maybe a poem or or maybe a poem or or a poem . 
the name from a old the that i bought on the the . 
i had to realize that it was much fun fun . 
i could never imagine . 
it 's fun fun because it 's not about to train memory . 
you 're always better better better better better and better , these crazy , the , the , , , , , and hopefully images images to your your eye . 
i 'm at it . 
here 's me with my the . . 
a couple of the and a the that that were up to two little of of , because the enemy is the enemy enemy of the . . 
i went to the same same i i had a year year after i had a year . 
and i 'm going to , , just as a experiment experiment . 
it could could be a nice - for my . . 
the problem was that the experiment did n't like like . . 
i won the , , which , which really should n't have . 
it was nice to to to and and and , and and , and , but that was n't what i wanted to do . 
that 's just tricks . 
tricks the work because they work on some simple ideas ideas the the of our our . 
you do n't have to build a - - or or or - to - to - to - to - to - to - to - to - how to can . 
we often often talk about people with people , , , as if it 's a special , but that 's not true . 
good good are are the . 
we 're going to better things when we look . 
we remember , if we 're getting . . 
we remember , if we have the possibility of figure out why information and and experiences are about us , why they have meaning , and we them them into something that we can sense of our sense of our , and we can call the " " " "
the the , , these the , , they all all . 
in fact , it 's not real real . . 
they work because they work us to work . 
they 're us to be and and , , in a way that we 're not usually . 
but there are not shortcuts . 
that 's how things things are in in memory . 
one thing i want to do with you , i i i was through , the man who did n't look at his the , , learned , our lives are the lives of our memories . 
how much are we willing to lose our our lives , our our our our , , instead of telling us to us , how much are we ready to because we are so lazy that we do n't have the and and ? 
i learned that the memory , in any of us , incredible incredible . . 
if we want to live a life life , we have to be the person who do n't remember . 
thank you . 
at the age of 27 , i i a a job job in the the for a the , and . 
public public schools in new york i i was to for the . 
as every teacher teacher i i , i and tests and 
i was homework homework . 
when the work work , i , i i grades notes . 
in the , the only difference between the best difference between the best and worst . 
the 's some of my students students students were not the . 
some of my favorite kids do n't get very well . 
that 's me me . 
what you do in the . in the , in math , is difficult to get : : numbers numbers , the , the , of a . 
but not impossible these concepts are not not . i i found that that that all of my students all students students students all the students to learn how to do it , hard and hard . 
after some years , i came to the conclusion , we had that we had a much better understanding for students and students and learn from a perspective of motivation , from a psychological perspective . 
what we do in the best is is the the . but what if if in the and and life , , much more than than the ability and easy and easy to learn ? 
so i left the classroom , and a a to to . . 
i started kids kids and adults in all kinds of different situation , and always wondered , who i am , and why ? 
my my , and i went to the west institute . 
we were trying to what what would would be the the the would n't . 
we went to national national national national and and the to to the children would would would . 
we studied the that worked in in very tough business , and asked them to teachers teachers the the the the of the , and and they were able to improve their students their students . 
we were partnerships with with and and , , who would their their their minds . 
and who would make the most money . 
in all these different ways , the evidence of an individual and and is . 
it was not social intelligence . 
it was n't good good , physical physical , and it was n't . . 
it was brilliant . 
and is is and passion and for for long term . 
it is the . 
and is is when you 're a a a , , not just a week , a month , but for years , and really hard to work to plan . 
you know , life is like a marathon , not the . 
i was started in in public school in chicago in chicago . 
i asked asked thousands of students students the the of the the , , and they and then they would come over a year to see who was made of the . 
it showed that kids with kids are even more difficult to the the , even even if i all all the properties properties things things like , , results , , , tests tests , even as they did they did in school . 
so do n't actually mean only in in and and and , but also in school , especially for children . 
the the the issue about this topic is that for me , that we know so much that science does n't know how much as you do . 
every day , my parents ask me and teacher teacher , " how do we study kids of children ? " 
how did i teach a a look at ? 
how do i do it for for ? " 
the answer answer : i do n't know . 
what i know is that you do n't have to be done . 
our data show that that a lot of of people are not not going to remain to . 
in fact , in our , not necessarily not necessarily not , , but it 's also talent with talent . 
so far , the best idea that i 've been to the the of of of , is called the the . . 
this idea was been at stanford stanford university of stanford university and the the that the ability to learn to learn not not to be able to change their their . 
dr. the showed that kids when when they read about the brain and learn how how it 's to the challenges and challenges and challenges , much more likely to do it much more because because it 's not a failure condition . 
this this posture is is an great idea for the . 
but we need more . 
i want to finish my finish , we 're already so far . 
that 's the work that 's us . 
we need to best our best ideas and and and and and and . 
we have to do whether we succeeded successful , we have to be willing to have to to to , to have to to lessons lessons and from from to . 
in other words , we need to see kids kids kids . 
thank you very much . 
in the center of my work is the connection of our to and and part of the environment , where architecture architecture architecture from the natural , local conditions and and traditions . 
today , i 'm like example , i 'm a example , projects projects . 
both of projects are in in , and in in ethiopia and in in tunisia . 
they also have common that the different different different different different perspectives are different part of the brain to become a part of the . . 
the first example started with a invitation , a the - in the in in capital capital capital . 
this is the kind of building that we us , my team and and me , as an example of what we should should be shown . 
first first i thought i wanted wanted to to . 
so after we 've seen a couple of these buildings -- there 's a lot of of the city -- we we that they have found three of the . 
first , these are the buildings , they 're very large , they 're very large , , people ca n't afford to buy things . 
second , they need a lot of energy because because the surfaces are glass glass , the heat inside inside inside , and then you need lots of lots . 
in a city , not should n't happen to , because they have pretty weather that that 's been 25 to 20 to 25 25 . 
and thirdly , you have their their with with and and ethiopia . 
this is a place in a place called a rich culture and tradition . 
and also , i was really really the first really of the old the old market with the old market with this the , , where people were going to go and and and , and , day , day , 
it has also this idea of space space that uses the uses - activity to create activity . 
so i thought , that 's exactly what i really want to design , not a a . . 
but the question was , how we could build a building , building building building with these principles . 
the next challenge came to when we were to this , because it 's in a a city town of the city , where most of the buildings you were sitting on the picture , there were n't there . 
it 's between two two two that have across a hundreds of meters . 
first first , we created a connection between these two streets , and then there all the the of the building . 
this is a a - a - that that creates a a a that creates a building in the building itself itself its own shape and its sun and and . 
and to get this the , we we the idea of a with a little with the little that that that in every every , because of the shape of the change , because of the change . 
i also think , how do we end up the building ? 
i wanted to really find a solution to go on the local . . 
i started thinking about think about how a a a concrete out of concrete with the , which the air air , and light light , but in the form form . 
and then i this this new buttons in the the the . . 
they have the properties of a a geometry , and that helped me to the entire entire . . 
we 're building this with little little little , , the windows that air air and light on the into the buildings . 
and that 's going through these little , , , the bits that light the light from the the of the to to to the building the building . 
it was n't just the the to to with ideas ideas , because they thought , " this is not a not - shaped . that did n't have . " 
but then we realized that we this idea of the the idea of the , is the idea of a idea of a , , because they can actually sell more more . 
the the concept of the was too much , much much much , not just because of the material compared , compared , but it because we because we had n't have a conditioning . 
so we created some the - that we used to to project . 
the first time was to think about how to make the building building , in a city city , a city that almost almost almost every day . 
we created a call the , by by on the roof on the roof . 
and under this the , , we we this this as a new space space with space and and , and that that this this this this . 
these these the on the roof roof , the water to the into the . . 
hopefully hopefully at the next year , because we have the the to 5 . 
the second example is a the - for for 2,000 in and in institutions . 
so to do a big project , the biggest project i 've ever been , , i had to understand the city of the city , but also the environment , the tradition , the tradition and the culture . 
and this analysis analysis analysis i i particular particular on the the , , which is the 1,000 - old structure that was from a wall , through 12 through , through and by the way . 
when i was to the the , the first step to to the the streets of the to create the first 12 of with with large size and and and like the in in and and other cities with these the . 
so , we , we some some points points in the into the into the concept of this , and and they them with straight straight , and the changed the original pattern . 
the final step was to think about the cell , the small cell of the project , as the as , as a a part of the . . 
what would the best best in in a a climate for a apartment ? 
this is the , because of the the between the between the between the two the that created created created and a natural natural . . 
so we put a pattern about the the that that most of the most that are are in in this direction . 
and that 's the result , it 's almost like a combination of a european and and the arab city . 
there are the blocks with the and and in the , , these are the these . 
it also also the local wall that would increase higher density in the upper and and a a density density in the . . 
it also also the concept of the . 
the volume has this shape form that has evolved through three different of of , , and also to very dense light light into the ground , , there are three different of , , like a a and a kindergarten and and a nearby of a of the that
the roof , my my project in this project , the community 's almost almost the space to the building . 
there can all all neighbors and and and and make things , like a a a on the morning , a a building to a building . 
these two examples have made a common approach of the . 
they 're in emerging where you can see the cities literally literally . 
in in cities cities changes changes changes the architecture of architecture in the and and future future of people people local local communities and and as as as as as buildings . 
and that reason , it 's important to architecture , architecture , but but solutions solutions solutions that are the the relationship between the community and the environment and the to to it and and to connect . 
thank you very much . 
i want to talk about trust , and i want to talk to you about the the opinions opinions . 
they 're so ubiquitous to they become the . 
there is one of my view . 
first of all : : : trust is a in in , , many . 
then we need to trust more confidence . 
and a task : we should build the confidence . 
i think the claim the the goal and the challenge to the wrong ideas . 
i want to give you a different story about a claim , a goal and a a a a a better approach to the . 
first of the claim : why do people say that ? 
and if i really talk to my talk , i know , i do n't know the answer . 
maybe it has some some in some or or or , or in some other . . 
i 'm not going to be the . 
but i can look at the surveys of the that the are are the the source of faith , that it 's a . . 
look at a look at a period of a , a lot of 
and will be people people who are 20 years ago , mainly journalists and politicians , still still . 
and the people who was very very , very , , , still very , : : , , , nurses . 
we 're other in between the way , the the the the almost almost almost almost in the middle . 
but is that a good proof ? 
the - -- -- -- -- . 
what could you be that ? 
so you look at the general people of people people when you 're going to be certain questions . 
trust trust politicians ? trust trust ? 
now , if you ask somebody asked , trust trust , you trust ? 
trust trust it 's ? 
trust trust it 's ? 
and then would you would say , " " " ? " 
and that would be a reasonable response . 
and if you answer the answer to you , you might say , " i 'm not some of you , but not . " 
it 's rational . 
in short , we 're in in short short , we 're trust in different ways . 
we do n't think of it that we every every or a a or or a in in an inner . . 
so i could say about that i i was given a particular , , , , , first grade , the first class , the , class , but i would n't want to go to the . . 
maybe i know i know that that it 's not going to be good car . 
i 'm that my my friend friend a a a on a , , but maybe not that she 's a secret secret . 
simple . 
so know how we know from our everyday ways , how different can look look , but why do we know this knowledge if we 're thinking about trust ? 
the the situation are doing a very bad thing about the actual , , because they ignore the sense of the that you 're in the . . 
second , , we get to . 
the goal is to trust more confidence . 
honestly , i think that 's the stupid . 
i would n't going to be that . 
i would try to trust the more confidence , but not n't n't . 
i 'm actually actively on the to not trust . 
and those who have to raise their savings to the hands of a certain event , which the way , the the , , " the the " " " " " i , " i think , , too much . 
" trust trust , is no the goal in this life . 
trust and be and be to be the goal . 
and then you say , yes , okay , what 's the most important is not not , , but . 
the people can people from . 
and to do that , we need to look at three things things . 
are you ? ? are you honest ? are you ? ? 
if we can a person person in the the topics , and , and , , we have a good reason to trust her , it 's be . . 
but the person 's probably not , , probably not . 
some of my friends are and and , and i would n't want to letter you letter letter , because they are the . 
i have friends friends that are very very their own own , but they 're kind of of them . 
and i 'm very happy about that i did n't have a lot of friends that are and and and , but are the . 
if you have , i did n't even have it . 
but after that , we look at it , then , trust . 
trust is the response . 
the we do n't need to do that , of course , that 's hard . 
over the last decades decades , we 've been trying to design the full - all kinds of treatments and and experts and experts and that make us easier to save their . 
many of these systems have the effect effect . 
they do n't work like . . 
a the said once said to me , " the problem is that the would longer be free than the baby to to the the world . " 
everywhere in our public lives , in our institutions , our institutions , our this problem , and this this is to to and and , , but to make the opposite . 
it 's how people people people are their their their tasks tasks by taking them . 
i can , can can any any of . 
so so 's what 's going to . 
the goal is more more , and that 's difficult to be if we want to be , and want to want to communicate and other , and if we want to to whether whether people are , or or or politicians , 
it 's not easy . you have to make it . simple reactions or not do n't n't know . 
and now to do the task . 
this as a as of the describe describe , the the . 
because it suggests that they should and trust trust . 
we can do that for ourselves . 
we can go a little bit . 
so 's two two people can improve your confidence . 
but ultimately , it 's a by being that by being done by one . 
you ca n't do that again what else do . 
you have to give you a serious that you trust . 
so you have to be be . . 
and of course , of course , is that you do n't usually all of the people at the nose . 
but they have to have to have older that they 're . . 
how does that ? ? 
that happens every day , everywhere . people people people do , , , , , , , effective . 
here 's a simple example example . 
the store , i made my hate , , she she me up and and ask them ask questions . 
they take them back and give me back to me , or some of the in in the . . 
that 's great . i 'll you you , because you 've been shown to me . 
there 's a morality of morality . 
you you think of the as as as , , it 's a very good good sense that you 're is , you you to be your own words . 
so our goal is not very difficult to recognize . 
it 's relationships between people people , and the the , and when the other is different . 
so the morality of history is so much much more about trust , or about about faith , or about the the or or the , or , and and lot more about and and how you people people , and and evidence evidence of the own . 
thank you . 
you know , the best thing i 'm most best for me , the films i can look . 
i love my own my with my my my kids , and when my daughter was four years old , we 've together together , " the " of " . " 
the film has n't left it . 
her , of course , was the . 
so she had a good excuse to wear a the dress , and a a the . . 
but if you look at this film often , you look at how he 's actually . 
we live in the today today and and our children in a a a a different . 
but " the was was by by . . 
he did n't have this trend . 
it has 40 years to continue this trend , -- -- interestingly -- a different movie , which a guy from a and a guy with a a girl a girl girl , they just like the the of the . 
you know , i know what i 'm talking about , right ? 
right . 
well , there 's a big difference between these two films , even several differences differences between the the of of of and and and the the movies that we 're looking at today . 
first of all , there are in " the of of " very very violence violence . 
the monkeys are pretty aggressive , as as the the . 
but i think if the had inspired by the government today today , , , the would said , " the , " the , you 're the the of that that we were been . 
use your shoes to your to to by computers computers , the evil evil of evil . " 
but it does n't happen . 
another point i 'm at the " " of " " " is unique unique , is that the and and and and and and are even characters characters . 
this is the first time when i was my daughter , star star , " i was , , was was was was was different . 
at that time , i had a son . 
he was at the time time three years old . 
he was n't invited to this that he was n't too young . 
but he was the second child , and he was less less than his sister . 
so he 's a , , and he 's the the film , he 's a a his mother , and , and i do n't think he 's going to what he was going on , but he 's it it 's in in . 
and i wondered what he was doing . 
did he the it courage courage , and and ? 
he he the that that a army army a a army to get the government ? 
he 's that there 's only in the the , , , and , of course , who is this really cool , but during the time , , , the the with a a and a a and to to him the the the the the the the ,
compare this with " the of of " " " . 
how does your the your your to to a good end ? 
by with all the and and a . 
this is the kind of world i i my children my my -- -- -- , , , right ? and not in the world , in which are to fight with what 's pretty much of our our world today . 
why is there so much -- -- -- -- -- -- in the movies that are children for our children , and so few so the ? 
there 's a lot of good literature about the impact that are about the boys of the boys , and they should read it . it 's very good . 
but i did n't read that much about how guys with this this . 
i know from a experience that that that that the could n't not to the the model model that i could have to to to to find through the world of adults , and girls girls and girls and common . 
i think there was this moment with the first kiss , when i really expect that the the starts to , because that ends ends up or right ? 
i 've my mission , i i the girl . 
why do you see there ? 
i do n't know what to do . 
the movies are very very to to the the and and and their heart , and there 's not a lot of space for other relationships and other . 
it does almost like as a young animal is a animal animal and when you 're a girl , you better better better . 
there are are exceptions exceptions , and i 'm going to be the the of of of any of you . 
but they give give a message to the young to the boys that are not not the . 
they are real at the girls to how they can to the the to the , , but they do n't show the boys to the they 're going to against the . 
there 's no way for you . 
there are also some women who are new stories , and write , and writing and and and and and and and and are also , and they 're still the . 
and the most common of of all the of of course , a classic after the other , and every single one of you , a a boy , or a man , or two of two men who are friends , and son son and son of two men
until many of you , you think of -- this year when they finally the the movie " -- " the the " 
i recommend him all of him . he 's on the internet . 
do you remember what the critic said , " " the " ? 
" oh , " i ca n't believe that has made a a . . " 
it 's very good . let 's not get it that . 
but as no one of these movies has the the the . . 
i do n't know if you 've heard of it . 
it 's not yet not to have that right , and to be , , but maybe we 're going to start today today . 
the the is a the and and in the middle of the the this conversation that she she with with a girlfriend about the films that had seen . 
it 's very simple . there 's only three questions you need to ask : there there 's more than a character in the film , which is the and and something ? 
try try to get that . . 
and talk about women women in the time of the ? 
and what 's in their entertainment is something else , the the guy who they like both like ? 
yeah ? thank . 
thank you very much . 
two women who exist exist and talk talking about anything . 
this is what happens . i saw it , and yet i see it it 's the the movies that we know and and . 
in fact , i went to the the , to see a very good movie , " the . " 
you remember ? a lot of a lot of the , great great , , a general a sense of what a good - is a good - . 
it falls with with the through the . . 
i think that should n't be , because of the time -- i do n't know if you 've seen it -- but a lot of the ordinary in in a message where men men and women and women during the the . . 
there are some good scenes that men in in this deep deep deep , of fear , and and the great moment , one of the the , is to go through a door and say , " you you go to bed , " ? ? " 
this is some some of hollywood . 
so let 's look at look at the numbers . 
in 2011 2011 , under the 100 of , , what do you think how many of these were actually actually in ? 
11 . that 's not a . 
it 's not so many of the number of women who we just just in the congress , so that 's the good . 
but there 's a number that bigger bigger than this is and this is this space . 
last year , the new york times published published published published the government . 
you you that you 're saying that you 're saying that 
one of five women in the united states that they 've been to to live in their lives . 
i do n't think that 's the fault of . 
i do n't think that have to do anything . 
i do n't think that that and and and directly to do something with something , but something 's going on , and when i hear this statistics , one of the things i think think that are many of . 
who are these guys ? what are they doing ? 
what do you do n't learn to learn ? 
take your story , that it 's the task of a male , the violence with violence violence violence and then the the the , , which is a woman who does n't have friends and not talking about it ? 
so let 's take this story ? 
you know , as a parent that has privilege privilege , a daughter , , just like the same thing that we do , we 're this world and and these statistics in and we want to to them . 
we have tools to how we the , and we hope hoping that help help , but i 'm also asking whether whether 's 's going to be , when we 're at the same time , active or , , , our our , , to their their .
the the is a means that we can do something very important , and i 'm talking to to the the . 
i think we need to do our very simple idea of a picture of 
the definition of the is already changing changing .

i want to talk to you about the story of a the . . 
i do n't know his name , but but his story . 
he lives in a small village in south . . 
his village is near near . 
the drought of the poverty and the and the the . . 
and when there was nothing there was him , , he left his village , and he walked into the city , in this case , the , the capital . 
when he 's there , there there no no options , no jobs , no way . 
at the end , he 's in a a outside outside of the . 
it may not a a year , but nothing . 
one day , he will be a by a man who would him him , lunch for dinner , dinner , to the . 
he 's this this dynamic group of young people and they give him an opportunity . 
he gets a little money to buy new clothes clothes and to to home and home . 
it 's going to be this young woman . 
he finally . . he . . 
he starts to new a new life . 
his life has a sense . 
and a a day day in the , , walk into a walk in the air . 
this the the with the was was the the and and and and group of young people had been the to have a a with a with with . 
how could the story of a the of just just trying to to to in the ? 
he had . . 
he had an opportunity to focus on the future , and a it , the was the first opportunity to him him . 
it was the first thing to him him from a state that we call " the . " 
and his story is again over again over the areas of the around the world . 
it 's the story of the , , , , , , , in the and london and and and and something something something something different than something . " 
young people are moving from from the city , their their , jobs , work , wealth , but young people do n't have a percentage of wealth . 
it 's often the the that are under the . 
in 2030 , three are five of five five five in five cities in the cities . 
if we do n't young people in the growth of cities , if we do n't have opportunities opportunities , they 're going to be the , , the the in in the violence in violence and in the cities cities . 
in my the , , , , , , 70 percent of the young people are unemployment . 
70 percent do n't have work , do n't go to school . 
they do n't actually do anything . 
last month , i went back after the , and i went to the the , the hospital where i was born . 
i remember , i was this this hospital , and i asked , what if i would never be here ? 
what if i had to the same condition of the " - forced ? 
would i have become ? ? 
i 'm not sure what i 'm going to do . 
the reason reason was was in this month was was was the fact , the of of a young - for for young leaders and entrepreneurs . 
i was about 90 young leaders leaders . 
we we got together and we started a solutions solutions for the largest challenges of their city . 
in the room , a young man , the . 
he he went the university university in and and and his his . . 
there was no jobs and no options . 
i remember remember , he told me that had a the , , and frustrated was the perfect goal goal , member member , and to be and and other . 
they 're people people . 
but this story takes another different . 
in in , , the biggest obstacles are to to from a to b , the streets . 
23 23 years , the have the the completely , , that that the the best best . 
and the , the opportunity and and they . 
he 's a a . . 
he started to stop the on the the that could could n't afford to afford . 
with his family and family friends , he bought his 10 and he he to be able to get his right at the next three years . 
how do you tell this story from the other ? 
what what makes the difference ? 
i think it 's his ability to to a new opportunity . 
it 's the the , and i think that the can be the means to be the means " 
it 's the young people in the the opportunity to create the that they 're desperately . 
you can teach people people to be entrepreneurs . 
i want to talk to you about a young guy who who one one of my favorite , : the the , a the . 
he helped me to give the the of some young people who are at the summit , and to show them how to build innovative and and . 
he 's actually the first the that has been seen since the , 22 years before until before before before was there , the the was that was that the that ship from the from the from the the , when you wanted to to the the wedding . 
when you ask somebody , " when did you last time you last time you ? " " the answer was many of the who the the of the " " " " never " " " 
so saw saw an opportunity . 
he started a the with a . . 
he was a a outside outside outside of and and started to the and and and , and what he said , in the climate climate . 
he started to talk to the flowers , and he was in and , and and to the the city , and he was working on the the of the first public public parks in the last . 
there 's no public parks in the . 
he wants to create a place where families and young people are together and and how he said , , he said , the beautiful things can enjoy the life . 
just 's the the , it does n't have a because because they too much to water . 
so the first step is to young people to inspire , and in this room , the has had a huge impact on the other people in the room . 
they never had really thought about it . 
they thought thought to work for a work or for for government government , but this story , his innovation , had a strong impact on it . 
he the them to look at their place as a place of view . 
he the them that they can be entrepreneurs to change the change . 
at the end of the day , they had innovative solutions for some of the largest challenges of their . 
they had the local solutions for local local . 
the inspiration of young people , and the the of a a is a really big , , but but people people people to to to their ideas to able to do able to do their ideas . 
they need the and and to to develop her business and develop business . 
they 're people people with the resources that they need , they give them the support they need to to to ideas ideas and they will going to create the for for growth growth . 
for me , me , more than me more than just a more of a . . 
it 's about social social . . 
the - sold sell not just flowers . 
i think he sold hope . 
his design is the , " when it created created , the view of people people to their city . 
the 's the the to who who to help him to and and the . 
he gave them the chance to the the the state of the " " . " 
these young businesses have a tremendous impact on their cities . 
so my suggestion is , you you to young people to get people , and and and their their innovations and and they 're more about about about flowers and and " " " " " and " " " " 
thank you very much . 
so during my childhood , my was was one of my favorite the to the on the on the the of of , because my parents are , happiness . 
but these are are hard to find . 
they 're from sand sand , barely barely . 
but after a certain period , i had a a . 
i began to see , , patterns patterns , who helped me , they they . 
and it was to to to find a passion to find things that i love for , and the . 
and when i started started studying studying , , i realized that see see see that my eyes eyes n't eyes with my eyes . 
because suddenly , in egypt , my my beach in a a a a miles , , along the the , and my my to the the of cities . 
and that led me me to use the . . 
i had to see differently to see the past in a map . 
so i want to show you how we example to we differently , if we use use . . 
this is a gentleman that in in eastern eastern called called the . 
and the the appears , brown , , we use but but , and , and it 's with with , , , suddenly that 's suddenly a sudden . 
what you see here is , the chemical changes changes of landscape landscape landscape through the and and and and the the . . 
what i want to share with you today today is how we used to used to to build a a city that which the name the name of the and and for thousands of years . 
the was the capital of the old egypt , , as long as a , a a , a a , a , , about years ago . 
the , the the is in the the , and it 's very efficient because it 's in the middle realm of the arts , the architecture and architecture and religion . 
and always knew that the the of of the would be somewhere by the the of the , , the two two , the the red , , but in the massive . . 
this area is huge -- it 's the four times three times three . 
once the , the , the , directly to to over the over , and while , and his moves changed and and towards the west , , he 's the city . 
so how do you find a city city in a a . . 
they 're to find to find the equivalent to find the needle in the , , with with eyes and the . 
so we used to the - to - map map a map of the landscape to see to see a , changes , 
where the the of the the used to be used . 
but you see , , and this is very interesting , this slightly the of , , with with the circle that we us as a possible position for the city . 
so we worked with with scientists scientists to to the what you see here . 
this is like the ice in ice ice , just instead of the layers , change , climate change , you can , layers , your human . . 
in a depth of five meters , under a layer layer of , , we found a density layer from the . 
this shows that that that this position position position for space , in five meters , , we we can produce more over several hundred years of the , to to to the to rich , to the to the to the the that we we existence existence existence .
we found the the -- the , the , the and the -- and what shows that that shows a a . 
it might not seem to look at much , but if you look at the the stones , which were used by the in the in the , , you find exactly the . . 
so we found a density layer of the the of at this that that that 's on the rich rich . 
we also found evidence for a for for the community society , which shows that that this is a very important city . 
but there 's no longer , , but we 'll going to get to these these soon , to to a a . 
what 's important , we we to teach for young young who who are in the school , so they 're so to have to make great discoveries . 
so i wanted to be my with my the from the middle of the , , it was in the the city of the the years ago ago . 
" knowledge knowledge sharing is the biggest of of the . . 
there 's nothing in this in the . " 
ted was n't 1984 1984 1984 . 
ideas , , , actually , in 1984 , in a long long , , , from the . 
you can see that the the the the the the the the the the . 
thank you very much . 
thank you . 
i grew up in taiwan as a daughter of a , , to my my memories , my my my my my my my my , the the , the , and the form of the chinese . 
i was , , i was fascinated by this this language . 
but for a , , it seems to as the as the great wall of china . 
i 've been wondering how i 've been able to do this wall , so everyone anyone to understand the interest of this complex , this , and understand and and . 
i thought that was a new way of learning , to be . . 
since five , the , i learned every single single every single every single in every single in the . 
in the next 15 years , i 've every new new new . . 
because we have just five minutes to have a , and very difficult , very difficult . 
a chinese the has about about 20,000 . . 
you need need 1,000 for a a . . 
the most 200 200 are giving them to 40 percent of the simple literature , to understand -- -- enough enough to the the the , and and the the the the of the time . 
today , i start with eight eight to show you how the method works . 
are you ready ? 
open your mouth as far as it until it 's . . 
it 's going to " a mouth . " 
this person goes to a . . 
" human . " 
when the the for for fire fire , a " with a person , if he was saying , " help ! i ! ! -- and the 's is going to the the of the , but i like this idea . you take the the the you you
this is a tree . 
" tree . " 
this is a mountain . 
the sun is . " 
the moon . " 
the the for for " the looks like a the from from the . . 
these eight are are . . 
they are the the to create a variety of . 
a human . 
if someone else is , , then it means " follow . " 
and then , more , , " and " " " and " a " . " 
if a human his his poor , , " he says , " it was so big . " 
the person in the mouth , it 's like . . 
he 's a " , " as a in the whale . 
a tree is a tree tree , two trees are a for a " . " 
three are together for a " forest . " 
and they put a a under under tree tree and they have a " . " 
if you put up a mouth , it it means " the . " 
just to to because because a is a is a is a . 
do you remember that fire ? 
two two two black people are hot . 
three fire fire together together a lot of . . " 
they put the fire under two trees , it it " " . " 
for us , the sun is the source of the . 
two two together together together . " 
three are together together . " 
when the sun and the moon , it means " it 's " . " 
in the context , it 's be for for the next day . 
the sun goes across the horizon horizon . 
door . a a in the door stands to the the . " 
so , put a mouth in the door , it says , " ask questions . " 
the , the . is there there ? 
this person the from the door . " " " " " 
the left is the the woman . 
two women are two for a " . " 
so , in three women , this is called " the . " 
we have now 30 of . . 
and with this method , you can put the in the first eight words . 
so the next group of eight eight are are in with other words . 
so with a little bit of a few hundred , you can learn how a child - old child . 
when we can make these , , we start to them them . 
for example , it makes a and and fire , so , " 
we know , japan is the land of the sun sun . 
this is the sun with the " " " because japan because of africa is china . 
one is with the is called the " " . " japan . " 
a human being a ? 
a japanese japanese . " 
the are the the on the left are two mountains . 
in chinese chinese , it 's " " , chinese chinese , her political chinese in the dark of the mountains . 
today , " " " " . . " 
a mouth says says where it 's , , " it 's " . " 
that 's the slide that reminds me of the stage , thank you very much .
