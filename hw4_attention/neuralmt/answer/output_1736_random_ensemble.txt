when i was in my 20s , i had my first the .
i was a and i was particularly in berkeley . berkeley .
she was a woman named alex .
when the came up the first , she came up and she a , and she fell into the couch in my office , the her and told me , about .
and when i heard that , i was .
my , had a patient as a first patient .
and i got a woman in the people who wanted to talk about .
i 'll leave that , i thought .
but i did n't get it .
with the stories , that alex opened into the , was easy to me just to with head , while we were the problems .
" 30 is the new 20 " , " alex , and as far as i did , i had right .
work came later , later came later , later came later , later came later .
people in the in the , and alex , i had nothing time .
but soon , my was my god , the .
i was .
i said , " yeah , you know , you 're with your with your , you with a , but she 's not going to marry . "
and there said my , " , " not yet , but maybe you 'll save the next .
and also , the best time to work on marriage , before they married . "
this is what psychologists call a the .
that was the moment that occurred that i did n't know the new 20 .
yes , people later to look at times as a , but did n't mean to do the the .
and so , the alex , the , the , and we got there and we sat them .
and i realized that this kind of the was a problem with real consequences , only for and their the , but for the , families and all people in the .
at this point , in the united states , 50 million people in the .
we talk about 15 percent of the population , or 100 percent , if you get to get the without the without going to go through the .
now , you , when you look at your .
i want to show you some of .
oh , yeah ! you 're all incredible .
if you work with somebody , the , loves , because of the , in the , i 'm going to see you -- . people in the really are really important .
my , my are in people in the , because i think that every single million should know what psychologists , and , the of the , and most things that you can do for the work for the , for happiness , perhaps
this is not my opinion . that 's facts .
we know that 80 percent of the the moments are to 35 .
that means that 10 of 10 decisions , experiences and experiences who are living with life , which is what you 're , until you 're 30 ,
do n't want to talk about you 're over 40 .
this group is going to be well , i think .
we know that the first 10 years of a , and how much money .
we know that more than half of americans are married or with the future partner or partner .
we know that brain his brain and big grow in the and to the , and what whatever you want to do to you do now time to do this .
we know that the are during the , when the , in the , and the women the of the and the and the and they to 35 things .
so in the , you should be the over the body and the possibilities .
if we think about the development of a child , we know that the first five years for years and are in the brain .
it 's time the , life has a impact on the future .
but we hear about little bit about there 's something like and our have a time .
but the people get n't heard in the .
the press talking about the the of the .
scientists call the of a - .
journalists , the of people for people in people in the like " the " or " the . "
that 's true .
so , as culture , we have the what the decade is the .
the that things are a with a plan and a little bit little time .
is n't that ?
so what happens when you put someone in the head , and say , " you , you get 10 years to make a little bit of your life ?
nothing .
this person is the the and the and the and it 's not nothing .
and so every day , people in the people like their or your sons and daughters into my office and say something like , " i know , my friend does n't good , but not n't tell that story . i 'm just the time
or you say , " all , as long as i 've done it for 30 years , it 's all . "
but later , it sounds like , " my are almost and i did n't have any the .
i had a better , when i had finished college . "
and then it sounds like this , in my , my , like the .
all the and they had fun , but then , 30 came up with the music , and everybody began to everybody .
i did n't want to be the only ones that i stayed . i sometimes i my husband , because he was in my chair .
where are people in the ?
does n't do that .
ok , that 's easy to say , but not does n't make any sense , because it 's about much .
if you have been to the , there 's a enormous pressure in the back to the a quickly , a city , a city , a partner and two or three children or two children in a lot of time .
and many of these things are the and like the are now just the and so all of all the time in the .
the does n't mean to the a to buy a red .
it means that you can do the career you do , do n't .
you ca n't have this kid , you ca n't want to be able or ca n't want to be able .
too many people in the and look at themselves and myself and say , " their say , " what did i have ? what did i just thought ? "
i want to change what people do in the and thinking .
this is a story that shows how it can .
it 's the story of .
in my , when she was 25 , she had it had a .
she said she 'd like to work in the arts or the , but she had n't decided to have , had in the last few years .
because the was , with her friend , who more his .
and although their were their years were been worse .
they often in the , but then she would her and said , " your family could you do , but your friends . "
one day , came very , and almost all the hour .
she had bought a and she and she spent the morning , her , but then you look at the that the " , " in the " in the "
she was almost the when she came up , and she said , " who 's going to be me if i have a accident ?
who will going to me if i have cancer ? "
i had to at the moment , to say , " i , " i . "
but the no music , really care about .
a needed took a better life , and i knew this was her opportunity .
i had my a my first time to my to , just like the .
and in the next weeks and months , i was three - three - who anyone to anyone whether or , or , should hear , hear should hear .
first , i told you , she had n't have any , she would be a very successful .
and i , to you to something that would be to .
power to make something that you think about is investment , invest in something you might be .
i knew about the , no one knows how the future of work , but i do n't know , the .
so now , time is this job , international this job , this , which is trying to try .
i 'm not the of the but not that the who did n't even have any .
this is the .
i said to , the , but the , but .
second , i said , the urban is .
good friends are , to get to the airport , but , the people with people who are like to think about how they 're what they what they think they how to they to and how they work .
this new this new person to the of the outside of outside of the own .
new things are made of " the " , so friends
it 's true : the half of the is not or not at all .
but the other half is not , and they have the .
half of jobs never have . if you 're your boss to your neighbors , your , your job , not a job .
this is not a . it 's spread information .
the last advice : what believed you could n't choose the family , but the friends .
this was for her as her , but as soon as soon as soon as soon as you were to your own family , if you 're a partner and a family .
i told her , time , a new family , would be .
you might think that it 's better than 20 than 20 or 20 , and i 'll agree to you .
but the , you to or in your life , if everybody 's facebook , is not an progress .
the best time to get your marriage before , before you have a , and that means that the in the love in love in love in your .
your family , means , consciously , the and the what you want , and not , because it works , or anybody to the time that you 're just .
so what happened to do ?
we walked her and found them the secret of a the who was in a different state in a museum .
this weak band is to get her work get a work .
and this gave her friend her .
now , five years later , it 's the for museums .
she has a man who she her .
she loves her new and new family and she told me a map in the , said , " now the line is " in the , you do n't get enough . "
sounds the sounds like this , it 's all easy , but that 's what i love about .
it 's so easy to help them .
in the , like the planes airplanes , the just left the and somewhere to west .
and after the , a little bit of the difference make the difference whether you or in .
this is true for the , the , or the , a good conversation , a beautiful , a very clear can have a tremendous impact for years and even over generations .
this is an idea that all the to that should knows .
it 's just as simple i to .
i 've the privilege to do this as a every day : the are not the new , so you on , you a , you use your own your own family .
do n't tell you what you n't , not .
your is now .
thank you very much .
in the entire , it was always our goal to take the distance between and information , which is between the world and our world on the screen where we can our imagination .
and this distance is smaller , smaller and smaller , and now it 's smaller than a millimeter that 's a , and computers are for every .
but i wondered what it would be if there was no limit at all .
i looked like what would look like .
first i 've this tool that i into the digital world , so if you put on the screen , it 's the physical .
designers can put their ideas directly into 3d and surgeons and to the of the screen .
so this was built by the tool that the was so the .
but our hands still remain outside the .
how can we do with the with the digital information with the digital information and the of our hands ?
in microsoft , i 've done with my mentor , the , computer and a little room in the keyboard in a keyboard .
that a that screen that screen and screen can make the of fingers and face , and you can put his hands from the keyboard , put the and with the hands .
and windows and put a position in the position room , you can easily it as you can a book from a shelf .
then you can through this book and you and , and all this , the of the the .
architects can their hands both their hands and .
so in these two examples , we 're into digital world .
but what if we could take that all the time and the digital information ?
i 've sure many of you have already to articles online later .
but now you have to worry about it .
here i have a " the . "
this view is you through a of your head or the , if you understand the system is geometry .
this idea of idea , i started thinking about it , the n't just look in the space , but it 's to make it , so we can them and feel .
how would a look like a future ?
in mit media lab , i with my the and my collaborators , i , a .
now , in this case , this is like a major - in our world , that means that computers , people can see this object everywhere -- at least this little bit of the .
effectively , we have the gravity and control the by magnetic , and these .
by adding the object , we it from the through the and time , and it 's possible to move movements and in the real world .
so example can be over - visual - , or the , or , and again in the real world .
students can use this to use complex concepts of physics and physics and physics and unlike a the or the , or a is a and experience that experience and it 's very powerful .
and more than that , just as we have now in the computer , it 's to imagine how the of the world is actually transform our daily activity .
as you can , digital will not only us to show us , but to start with interact with our part of our physical environment , ourselves of our world .
today , we 've started starting by talking about borders , but if we remove the limit , the only frontier is our imagination .
thank you very much .
i was been to for two years to become a the , in china , china , in the 1970s .
when i was in the first grade , i wanted to get government to school for school , all the paid .
but my mother said , " no . "
my parents wanted me to become a .
after they the , they believed they were that the only way to happiness , and safer , good job .
it 's not important if i do n't have the job or .
but my dream was to become a chinese the .
i 'm that i on my .
a - to has to start with the start , so i tried to try to go to the .
i wrote even the and the to the of a .
but the adult does n't give my idea .
the adults did n't believe it was me to me .
only my friends had me , but they were also only as children as i as i .
and i 15 years old , i knew i was too old to with training .
so my dream would never be true .
i was afraid of fear that i could only could to the rest of my life .
but that 's such a .
so i had to look at the head , and i could find another .
no one was to me something about it ? well .
so i to .
i the my hunger to the with this book , and a " of the family of " a " woman , " the the tradition , "
[ " the " ] [ " ] " from the ] the , i got in the united states and what books did i read first ?
of course , books that are in china .
" the good earth " from life of the chinese .
it 's just not just as propaganda . i understood .
the bible is interesting , but weird .
but that 's a subject for another .
but the fifth thing i gave taught me a way of " , " you want your father and your mother your mother . "
" honor " i thought , " that 's so much and much better than " . "
that was my way to and to and to the and relationship to my parents .
through with a new culture , i started reading the reading .
this was a lot of explosion .
for example , i did n't really get this very interesting first because chinese students are with this .
it never occurred to me that china is not going to be in the center of the world .
so a tells something about personal .
the , the reading is not new .
in the academic world , it 's a the .
there 's even the like the and the .
comparison and a understanding of a .
so i thought , if you read reading in the research , why does n't live in everyday daily ?
so i began to read two books at the same time .
you can act by people -- [ " franklin by the , " john " by john adams , david ] that was the same , or friends with common experiences .
[ " we " from " the " -- " life is a the of the -- and i 've stories different cultures , like joseph the book , " joseph " ] and for example , had to three .
in were , the , the political events , political and nature .
they were all they were all nature , and social -- interesting .
if you make a physical , it also fun to read the the in languages .
[ " the for " for a thomas called " the of the water -- the the of " the " rather than me in translation , i found out how much i can win .
i 'm to think of by , i think , " happiness " happiness " happiness " happiness . "
" in " means " new " new . "
books for me , a , through , and i 've got a connection to the people and the present .
i know that i never feel , or i 'm feeling .
a dream is really nothing to comparison what many other have .
i came to come to that it 's not the only purpose of a true . true .
his purpose is to us to get to where dreams , where our passion and our happiness .
even a dream can be this purpose .
because of , i 'm here today , happy , happy with a with a purpose in life and with a lot of time .
you 're always be with .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you very much .
when i was eight years old , a new girl was in the class , and she was so amazing , as girls as girls .
she had the hair and a little the , was good in and .
i was in the , i until i until a the plan .
so i stayed a little bit longer school , a lot of longer , and i was in the hidden .
when the air was , i came into , i went into the classroom , i took the the of the .
and then i did .
i the the notes of my the , just , just some few .
all the the .
when i wanted to make this book , i noticed to me that some of my other had to be pretty good .
so i in the all of the , no .
i gave all of all , and i myself , because i was because i was also all the time .
i 'm still more about my behavior .
i do n't understand where the thought came .
i do n't understand why i 'm so good at that .
i felt really good .
i do n't even know why i never been for .
it was so obvious .
i never got caught .
but most of me , why is it so that this little girl was so good in the ?
i 'm not happy .
she 's so , .
we know babies under .
similarly , primates . the are inherently from nature .
we know that the of the is among in the united states .
but i never a study that i could their or their or their .
so we need to the literature , because the novel is the laboratory that in the in the context of their forms .
is it a to say that if we do n't have any of , we have no literature ?
so no do n't have a the , " no " . "
no the king , not " the " . "
no shakespeare .
because , as the the of the , we , " and " and " the " the " the . "
no , no , no , . i know that it 's in to say that the has the answer everything has , but in the , he has really it .
this year , we this , the , the the of " the " for " for the time , and his analysis the to the and the , and my thing that we have hope .
think , think , think , right ?
we think of the little boy that we try to sleep .
we think about a piece of cake , in the .
we forget how to his vision .
we forget how the it is .
these are books are like the as the .
i do n't know how the is , but let 's say , it 's a .
let 's look at why the and the , the and so well .
is it obvious that , to -- , such a basis for a story ?
i do n't know . i think it 's just hard to the , because think , what happens when we 're .
when we 're at the , we tell ourselves a story .
tell us stories about the lives of other people and make them feel bad because they 're so much that it 's bad .
as a , of the history , and the audience we know what the detail has to the into the .
and we all to us , and so that 's the .
in the first band , " in world , the , one of the great , thinks about his care and , as you as it , and , " i wait , i love this woman would love someone
everything you give me and me joy , might be happy to joy , even in this moment . "
this is the story that he tells telling , and from there to the to the that he 's a new , he 's in the his of his , his in his private the .
we 've got to admit that the and the are .
and friends have to leave the country if they want to with it .
but you do n't need to be to realize that it hard work . right ?
there 's a .
it 's a feeling that 's to be .
what do the ?
it 's like information .
i want to .
it 's like the hair and little .
i want to get photos .
so 's why it 's so successful .
basically , the language of science and science and the .
when the these , suddenly out of the door , and the the of his , he this behavior .
he says , " you think you 'll be that 's a , but it 's not nothing to see a text , or a text . "
he says , " there 's scientific worth value . "
and what 's trying to show is that the is and makes us look at , but in their core , you 're looking for a truth , truth , truth , and the truth , the more , the better .
in , that 's for the way to wisdom .
he says , " a woman that we need to suffer us , us a greater and a more and more than the genius of a man who 's interested . "
he tells us about that we should look at women ?
no . i think he 's us to say that he tells us to tell us about ourselves .
is there another different sense that we us in this particular way ?
how do we feel our and our and ?
and we , we do n't feel different with different kinds of sound ?
freud , later , write about this .
one day was a by a very young man who was who was by the thought of his wife that his wife was .
and freud says , this man is kind of strange , because he does n't even know what his wife does .
because she 's innocent , and everybody knows that .
the poor creature is the under the .
instead , he looking for his , without it , so , behavior .
she too , she to with a man ?
[ freud ] says that the man is the of the of his wife .
the novel is very good at this point .
the novel describes very well , how much hard us , but not .
because the more we are , the more we it to us .
so i think that way that we do n't get to do to do things or illegal .
i 'm to be very .
and i think about myself about eight years , but i think also the story i 've in the news .
a woman from michigan was written , because she was designed by a himself of a the year , the news himself .
a year .
she tried to get her new friend of her shoes into the shoes , and i stopped when i heard , i was with .
because ... let 's be honest .
what does it mean , if creativity , creativity , right ?
this is something from a novel .
this is something from a novel the .
the is one of my favorite .
she 's the most the and most woman the american .
from her , " the " in the " the the mr. the , " it books to how to you , and we 're once in the realm of the , in the in between the and what could be --
take a the , your character .
first , want to be tom , and have what they have , and it 's what they had once , and they are like by the , and he calls to their name , he name her , her the .
this is a way .
but what do we do ? we ca n't make it as tom .
i ca n't give the world anywhere , even though i 'd like to make it on some days .
it 's a shame , because we live in a time .
we live in a live - era . time .
we are all good social media that are is .
do we show the ? i 'm not sure .
but we do what do when you 're not safe if you 're in a .
let 's go back to the street and ask questions to the .
think about think about the , you think about professor as a professor , this great .
but i liked to the , the boss of the with the face of a rat , the the needs , needs , the the genius , it 's him to .
that 's me familiar .
so , needs his help , put him and the stories of stories .
but as you start to start starts to something , and eventually in " the six , as the , and all of his solution , the the is to the and says , " we 're not the on them , mr. the .
we 're proud . them . "
and he 's that there 's no to - the - , - the - hand - , - hand - hand ,
this is one of the few times that we see the in his stories , and i 'm these little very , very , but also 's a .
it seems like that 's not an emotional , but a problem .
in a moment , a is a on a different like .
and in the next moment , they 're on an wavelength .
suddenly , it 's to this , he has him .
is it really easy ?
what if really was a really problem , if it was just about how we deal with the other in ?
maybe we would n't be to be the same .
we could make us .
but i like the .
while we 're waiting for , we still the literature as a .
literature alone , the .
literature alone , she can the , .
and who 's all the : the good news , the the tom , the crazy the , the .
we 're in society .
thank you very much .
i was about 10 years old and on a the - old with my father in my father , a the - in the northern of the new york .
it was a great day .
the forest .
the sun would look at the petals like the the like glass , and if no have been , you would almost that we were the first people that are through these forest .
we came to our the .
i saw the little hut on a cliff and across a the , beautiful , as something called horrible .
behind the roof , a , four square , with the , the and a old the .
i was amazed , i was angry and confused .
the were lazy to the , what they had -- who were , would they would to ?
the question was asked me and i asked them : they were them .
who we after us ?
how do you also or where " might be , who are behind us behind us in istanbul ?
who 's behind us behind rio in or in paris or in london ?
here in new york the , the the of every day of day was tons and 2000 tons .
i wanted to them -- as individuals .
i wanted to understand who make the job .
how is it to wear a uniform and wear ?
so i started a with a .
i drove the , the and went to and in the city , and i was a lot of , but i was still a .
i had to go deeper .
so i took a job as a .
i did not just working with the truck . i was the .
and i was the mechanical the and the snow .
it was a wonderful privilege and an exciting experience .
everybody asks after the .
he 's there , but not as the as you think , and days , it 's really bad , you 're pretty quickly .
and you to the weight , you just hard .
i know people who were this number of years , whose body , still , that weight her body , tons of every week .
and then there 's the danger .
after the statistics of the , the is the under the country in the country , and i learned why .
you 're all the entire day , traffic , all over .
everybody wants to and often do n't have to be .
that 's really bad for the workers .
and the garbage itself is full of the that the from the the and terrible .
i learned about the the of the the .
if you look from the the and from the back of the city , a city , you can see that the is like a itself .
he does n't listen to .
it 's also like a kind of or .
it 's always to be in motion .
and then there 's the stigma .
you put the uniform and , somebody -- whatever -- whatever -- you get your traffic or your or you 're going to close to your apartment , or you can your coffee your and you and say you
i find this particular because i believe that believe that the staff of the most important of the city of the city . that 's three reasons .
they 're the of the health .
if you do n't waste the waste , every day and efficient and it would take the of the and the and the would give us on very .
diseases that we 've been achieved and decades and control , and would spread and us .
the economy takes it .
if we ca n't do the old stuff , we do n't have a place for the new , and the motors of the to start to the , the is the is the .
i do n't know the capitalism , i just only the .
and then that 's what i call our , .
so i just do just how fast we 're today movement .
we do n't care about ourselves , our , our or our , or , or .
we take them , throw them away , forget , because we know that people on people on the other side , are taking care about .
so , i want to today some ways of how we think about how to think about how to improve the and them into those entertainment how you create a city that are sustainable and .
your work , i think , is kind of the .
you see the streets every day , regularly .
they carry in many .
you know when you can expect it .
and your work does our .
they 're like a .
the that you , us , imagine before us before our , the , and has to be more and to any price .
on days after 9/11 , 2001 , i took the of a the on the street , and my son and son and the and there was a man who drove his , he was doing it .
and i tried to him to work -- day , day days , but i started to cry .
and he looked at me and just looked and said , " everything 's fine . "
" everything 's fine . "
first later , i started to learn my research and the husband .
his name is the , and we worked together , we eventually got good friends .
i wanted to believe that the was right .
everything is good .
but in our efforts , change the way we on this planet as a planet , we need to look at the cost of the cost , including the very cost of the work .
and we have to be informed to help people who do this work , how we think about how to create systems about , which is a of the last 40 years and the world , and to us to a species of waste species that are can be
the more fundamental , we think when we talk about , three percent of the national .
it 's a remarkable statistic .
in your daily , in your lifetime , if you see next to see somebody next whose job is to make them behind , they take a moment time you 're .
take a moment to get to .
hello , hi , what goes ?
that 's not enough .
hello , hi , what goes ?
my name is the and i 'm not drunk , but the doctor of my birth already .
he 's got six directions and me , little bit of the air .
so i what i 'm doing is what i means i
look at that .
it 's a . i 'm a of , and .
and it 's not genetically .
it 's not a the . you ca n't get it .
nobody has the of my mother 's , and i did n't get it because my parents are so afraid what they are .
you get through accidents , like the day my birth .
i have to warn you . i 'm not a source of inspiration , and i do n't want anybody to me with me because you all have been in a point in your life .
and just 's just going to .
it 's just a christmas in christmas , and you see the beautiful circles of looking for a and what you see ?
the .
and you thinks , " why ca n't i be a little bit ? "
i have to say you , i 'm 99 problems , and it 's only one of them .
if there was a of , i a .

the park in new jersey my hometown .
i love the fact that my favorite and my have the same .
and , i love the fact that i could go home from my home to new york city if i wanted to .
many people do n't run with hot , but my parents not n't not to " a " . "
this was my father 's " yes , you can . can . "
so if my three older sisters , i , i with mit .
when my three older sisters down to school , my parents to , so i could go , and if we were not all the , we all the the my mother 's mother .
my father taught me to walk when i was five , by my his feet on his feet , just the .
another of his was to a of my front of my nose , so i 'm going to get them .
my inner was very strong , and as -- yeah , so , the first day i was , i was like a the who had a .
there was only six only in my city , and all my family were all my family .
today , we have 20 in the city , and they 're still all my family .
i think nobody has ever noticed that we do not have a .
it was before , and before it took for the , " i hate to use " as "
people i grew up with did n't have with my faith .
but they were very concerned that i could possibly maybe could .
and i explained to tell you that i was going to live three entire three entire life , so , from the to the to the .
i have the .
yes , on , it 's crazy .
my parents could n't afford to afford , so they sent me to the .
i learned how to make on , so i can walk on .
and i 'm from the , where it 's really important to be , so if my , my , then i also .
and if my friends their the coast of the coast of the , i do n't .
i spent my summer in a summer because my parents were afraid that we if we go to every single summer , one day , day .
the the often that my dad wanted to me , so i used to milk of the , and into the dead sea , and i know how the water in the eyes and i thought , " it worked ! it worked ! "
but we found a , : .
i have to say it 's really boring , but before i did , i was a - old , who ca n't even be .
now i can stand on head .
my parents always me that i would be able to make sure that not was not impossible , and my dream was to be the general . "
because of the , of , i had a great scholarship on the university , who had the state , because i 'm every minority of .
i was kind of the the of the the .
all me .
i do n't like all of the to so much , in all my all , getting in all of their .
every time i a from the " the , my teacher .
but i never got a role .
so in my , the , piece of " dance , dance ,
a piece of a girl with .
i was a girl with .
so i everywhere , " finally , i get a role !
i have a !
finally !
thank god , thank you , i 'm free ! "
i did n't have the role .
the brown had got the role .
i was to the of the , i the , when someone had my cat , and she asked why she said me , she said that i would n't want to do the .
i said , " sorry , but if i ca n't , if you ca n't do the character . "
i was born to this , and she gave them a without a .
college the life .
hollywood is known to physically healthy .
after i went back to my first part was a the in a the .
my dream was true .
and i knew that i was soon to " the "
but instead , i was a the that was just the , and i realized that the did n't have a , .
they just perfect people .
but you know the .
i grew up with the , the and the , and all of these women had a common : they were the .
so i became the .
my first job was to famous york city from new york city new york new , and i 'm never going the face of the first time i ever , forget , he realized that were to the streets to new jersey with a the with a the
i was in the united states , the united states , i 've also been the east in arabic , the and the .
some people say , i 'm the first - in the arab world .
i do n't want to ask the first , but i know that you never heard about the bad little bit that women are not , and they find us .
2003 , my brother from a mother and father , dean , and i was to new york new american that already to be .
our goal was to the most exciting image of americans from the media and to the at the point that , and , and not .
the of the was much easier than the challenge the of .
my great breakthrough was in 2010 .
i was been to the in the the " the " the .
i was like to the the river , she 'd me into a studio and i sat on a chair .
so i looked at the the looked at and said , " sorry , i get a different chair ? "
and she looked at me at me and she said , " five , four , three , two ... "
and we were live ! live !
so i had to make the table on the table of so i was n't feeling the from the screen , and when the interview was finished , i was .
there was my opportunity , and i had her , and i knew that i never back .
but mr. the invited me , but he made me a to an the and my chair .
and working with the i 've been working with a i 've learned something like all the internet .
people say , kids are more , but as a child or adults , or never been me .
in the world of web , i 'm my of my the .
when i look at online , i see like , " the , why ? "
" the , is the the ? "
and my favorite : " the .
did you have ?
we should be for them . "
even , my disability into the the , : the , the , the .
a disability is such as .
if a ca n't play a video game , ca n't play a play .
the are the biggest -- yes . that 's a worth value .
people are the most the largest minority in the world , and we are the the in the .
the doctors said , i never walk , but i 'm sitting here .
but i would be with social media , i would n't be here .
i hope that we can make a picture of in the media and create .
maybe there 's no way to the internet when it more positive .
or maybe not .
maybe it 's still a village to a child .
my journey with the me a few of very special places .
i put on the red next red the and the the .
i was in a film with adam the and with my , which is amazing by .
i 'm as a the with the the " the " around the world .
i was a huge the - in new national center in 2008 .
i 've been a the 's " , a , who 's trying to give the to the chance of a chance that my parents my me .
but the one that moment that most -- before -- this -- the , when i first the how the a and how a bee , the has the way and the way that i do n't .
this was the only time that my father ever seen a the of and i and i was going to talk to this presentation .
: god your soul , your dad , dad . my name is the , " if i can , you can . "
there was a time where we 're big .
on the 21st , july , the from the apollo and , and , and the , the of the ocean .
armstrong and the were alone , but her on the of the was the of a the , .
the the was the largest in history of the united states of america .
to the moon , it 's about billion dollars worth of worth , four or four percent of the .
apollo was created for people , and the collaboration of the companies , universities and universities .
people died , including the of the apollo .
but until the end of the end , 24 people to the moon .
from the that its surface , it 's the , after death , last year , now .
why did they go ?
they did n't go back to the , the old , and something , which all the 24 later -- a new sense of our home is small and fragile .
why did they go ? the , they went , because president had wanted to show the that his nation had the better .
but the on words on a university of the university of a .
for the , was just an victory of the across the east during the cold war .
at the time , this was a feeling of feeling of the about the forces of technology .
it was a to the moon because it was something great .
the the - a - a - a - class series of technological .
from the first half of the 20th century , the and the and the , and a vaccine against a .
and in the middle of the century , polio and eradicated .
technology seemed to something about what 's called a the a " the . "
for most of the human history , we could n't even faster a horse or a boat , a year , but the apollo 10 pounds about 10 kilometers per hour .
since 1970 , no human have been on the moon .
no one has ever faster than the of the apollo , and the optimism is about the power of technology , because the big problems we 've had to do with mars , clean energy cancer , or the world to the , seem to
i remember as a the , as i as a the .
the of the apollo 17 saw me and my mother me not very to the very the of the the .
i had a idea that this was the last final , but i was going to be that there was still alive in my life .
the the " something with our ability to be big problems with technology to become a .
you hear it everywhere .
we 've heard it in the last two days ted .
it 's a that if us had us to and ourselves themselves with , with things like things and social media and social media , or algorithms , the .
it 's nothing wrong with the of these things .
they have our lives and .
but they do n't solve the big problems of humanity .
what happened ?
there 's a explanation from silicon valley where you have that in recently , less than any employees , in years , intel , apple , apple and the .
in silicon valley , you are markets , in particular , the special of companies , which are the company .
silicon valley says that of course , that way to have to engage , and , and problems .
but this explanation is not good enough .
it explains mainly what does n't silicon .
even their times , small little , tiny , a 10 years 10 years .
investors had always been to invest in technologies like energy , which is a the and development , and never , never been able to solve the problems of no problems .
no , the reasons why we ca n't solve a problem , complicated and more .
sometimes we not consciously to not the big problems .
we could fly to mars , if we want .
nasa , even has a plan .
but to be a political decision of public , and that 's why it will never happen to
we 're not going to fly to mars because everybody thinks that there are be the on the earth that are done .
another time we ca n't solve the big problems because our political systems are fail .
today , less than two percent of the earth 's earth from the , sources , like solar wind , wind and less than two percent , and the reason is very .
coal and gas are cheaper than solar wind and wind and efficient is cheaper than the .
we all want to alternative that can keep the , but no exist .
now it 's so , and all of all the same opinion , what national and international development , and mainly : mainly , in the development of development and development and a price for carbon .
but in the current political climate , there is no hope that the u.s. of the united states or the international , or the international the .
sometimes are problems that sounds like , not .
it 's been believed that the is going on the .
but 30 years of research have taught us that political impact .
technologies can things like systems like systems and , and , but it will be more , and there are no way to do it .
eventually , sometimes we are sometimes to because solutions because we do n't understand properly .
president was the war of war , but you discovered what discovered that there are many kinds of cancers , which is of the of the , and only for the last 10 years , is going to be effective .
difficult problems are difficult .
it 's not true that we ca n't solve great problems with technology .
we can , we have to , to have these four elements , : politicians and politicians must be interested in order to solve a problem , institutions needs to solve it ; it needs to be a problem . and we have to understand it .
the the that led to a metaphor for the ability to be able to solve the big , to these things .
but this is a model that 's not going to happen in the future .
it 's not the year .
there 's no battle struggle like the cold war no such as john , who 's all and to a , and not a the like the of the solar system .
but in the , it was just end to moon .
he was only three days .
and it 's really that whether it 's really a serious problem .
we are ourselves and the solutions of the future will be to be harder .
god , it does n't be us to challenges .
thank you very much .
i want to you your eyes .
imagine you 're going to your .
look at the door , their color and the material made of it .
now , you a group of the - on their front .
it 's a the - , and you come up and you and your .
you to this .
they 're the down , and directly on .
and then they all directly into your .
bicycles , wheels , all the , and . the in the .
now , you have the in your , or what 's on the side of your brain , and , how the in the room .
the light seems to the .
it 's you from your desk from a the .
one horse .
you can almost like , his blue gets your nose .
you the the that it into the mouth .
go over to him , over in your living .
here you want to be your .
her clothes just the , she , " she had always touched a , while she 's on your the .
now , i 'm going to look at your kitchen .
the floor was replaced by a yellow the , and it 's called the , the the , the the , and the the of " from the ' , " hand .
okay . now , open eyes .
i want to tell you about a very competition , year in the new york in new york city .
it 's called " the . "
a few years ago , i wanted to know about this as a the as a the and the who the of the .
it was a bunch of new and some few of , and very different and .
they 're looking for hundreds of numbers .
the learned of the names of and the of the of and
and it whole thing just in minutes .
they were the who the of a of a the - the .
this is crazy .
these have to have skills .
i started to talk to some of them .
this is ed , a guy who was from england , and there 's one of the the .
and i asked him , " ed , when did you notice you have this particular ? "
and ed said , " i 'm not a the .
i just have a average memory .
everybody who 's here , you 'll tell you that he or she just has a .
we 've all , we , techniques , to these incredible techniques , which is the two years ago , the same techniques that used to his to and to the to books .
and i just , " wow , how does it have never heard of it ? "
we stood outside the and , and this wonderful , brilliant , brilliant , and funny the english says , me , " josh , you 're a american journalist .
you know , " you ? "
i said , " what ? what ? " ? " ? " ? "
" i 'd like to talk to the how to order to order a order of a the of the .
it would be the world prove that this is everybody . "
i told him , " i 'm not , but i but i would teach you teach .
i mean , you 've got to start somewhere , right ?
and that was the beginning of a very interesting journey for me .
i 've spent a lot of the next year , i spent not just to my memory , but also it , and to understand it , how it works , why it does n't work and be its potential .
i have a lot of really interesting people .
this is , for example , this is , for example , is
he 's suffering under the , and probably the worst memory of the world .
his memory is so bad that he does n't even be his the . what 's amazing .
although though it was so tragic , he in it , how much our memory our us to who we are .
on the other side of the spectrum , i learned to the side of the spectrum .
the .
he was the most of the the character in the movie " . "
we spent a afternoon to the public in lake city .
and i came back to a whole of flying over the memory , which was two years ago , and in the in the and in the in the .
and i 've got a whole bunch of interesting things .
and especially me , there was a time to the to the , not nearly as much as the as today .
there was a time that people in their memory , it 's the .
over the last few decades , we 've a series of technologies -- from the to the , to the the , the , the , the , the -- it easier to our , the human ability to
these technologies have our modern world , but we us at the same time .
they 've changed us , and i would argue that they have us to have us .
without the , seems sometimes it seems like we .
one of the last places of this earth , you still find people who still are passionate , and , and , and that is unique .
in fact , it 's not unique , there are like this around the world .
and this has me in the , i wanted to know how these guys do this .
a few years ago , a university at university london group of a brought into the lab .
you wanted to know : is the structure or the of your brains is different than the rest of us ?
the answer was : no .
are you smarter we ?
she gave them a the , and the answer was : actually did n't .
there was a interesting and a interesting difference between the brain of a brain and a and a that was compared .
if you put them into a the and , your brain , as you can imagine , faces and pictures of pictures of you can see that the regions of regions of the brain than the rest of us .
it seems like they 're using the part of your device using for the and using .
why ? and can we learn from something ?
the to the memory of memory is a by a kind of a - that every year , every year to a new technology to the a more of more and more and more and the rest of the rest .
this is my friend ben the , the .
on the table , front of him , 36 of the the , he himself within an hour with an technology that he invented and as a .
it 's a technology around the of the in order of 140 , the , in a half an hour .
yes . yes .
and even though it 's a of techniques to put things together in these the , but they all created the techniques on the concept that psychologists called the .
this so - the - this particular concept , this is : how follows : if i look at two to the same word , and you say , " you saying that there 's a person called " . "
this is his name .
and i say , " you know , there 's a person who 's a . "
now , if i go back to a moment now you back to you , and say , " you the word i 've ever been before you before you ?
you know what you 've done ? "
the person who person the person who is called , with to think of probability , the word that person who person the person who person the person .
same word , things the , ; it 's strange .
what 's going on ?
well , the name of the means is nothing .
he 's absolutely all of all the the that in your head .
but the profession of the , we know .
so white the .
so , have a on their hands .
smell good when they come home .
maybe we may even know a .
and when we hear that word first , we this with the word , the word , which it later .
the secret what happens to the , and the secret of to be able to realize better , to find the names of the into the , -- a information that has no sense in meaning in meaning in ways meaning in relation
one of the most techniques can two 500 years back to the of .
she was known as the known .
the story of his story : it was a poet called the who a the .
he was the for the conversation , because , when you were a really big , you would n't want to be a , but a .
he 's his poem from the memory and the room , and the right the moment , the moment the line behind me and all the .
not only not all dead , your body are to the the .
nobody one can tell anyone who was , nobody knows where who is .
the body can not be properly .
it 's an tragedy after the other .
the 's outside , the only way of this -- it 's his eyes and suddenly he 's he that he 's going front of his eye , where .
and he 's the hand and hand it through the to the .
now , this moment , we something that we all know that we do n't know how much we , we can we a very good and memory .
i would like to ask you to first the first 10 words of the story about the , so you find it hard to find it hard .
but i bet if i ask you to remember , who remember standing in this moment on a horse in your horse , your , then you might have the .
the idea of the is to create a building and a and it with the images of the things -- the dark , the , the , the , the , the , of the as it 's to .
this is a high - based that on over 2,000 over 1,000 years old , about memory .
so how does it work ?
you 're invited to you to talk about ted talk , and you keep it out of the , as it would be done , he 'd been to years ago .
you 're like to imagine you imagine you want to imagine your .
imagine a secret crazy and crazy story with a wonderful pictures , and remind you that you first to about these crazy talks .
and then you put your house and you hit the back on the back of mr. .
and that would remind you to start your friend ed .
and if you look at color , you to a that you to tell .
you put into your kitchen , and the fourth thing you to talk about was the strange journey that you for a year . and you 've got friends you to remember you remember you remember you remember .
so , this research was found out of their -- not word , word , " to be , topic .
the english term " the , " a theme of , comes from the greek word "
these are some of those people when people about and in terms of
the " the first " actually " is " first in your " . "
i was just that i was just fascinating and i 'm still
some of the - .
i wanted to maybe something about this the of the the .
but there was a problem .
the problem that the are the - are - are .
it 's like a group of people who sit sitting there and write a test .
it 's already exciting if somebody 's the .
i 'm journalist , i need something to do something about it .
i know that the things that i think about the people in the people , but i do n't have access to it .
so if i wanted to tell this story , i had to able to do it .
and so i began to every morning every 20 minutes 20 minutes before i started with my newspaper , i was something about something .
maybe a poem or maybe a poem or a poem .
the name from a old the that i bought on the the .
i had to make it was much fun .
i could never imagine .
it 's fun because it 's not about to train memory .
you 're always better and better , these crazy , the , the , and hopefully images to your eye .
i 'm at it .
here i am with my the .
some the and a the that were up to two small two of because the greatest enemy of the .
i went to the same i had a year after i had a year .
and i 'm going to , just as a experiment .
it could be a nice - for my .
the problem was that the experiment did n't like that .
i won the , which , which really should n't have should happen .
it was nice to and , and , but that was n't what i wanted to do .
these are just tricks .
tricks the work because they were on some simple ideas the of our .
you do n't have to build a - or - to - to - to - to - to - to - to - to - how to can .
we often talk about people with people , as if it 's a special , but that 's not true .
good are the .
we 're going to better things when we look .
we remember , if we 're getting .
we , if we have the possibility of figure out why information and experience are about , why they have meaning and , when we can them into something that 's sense in our sense of the , we can the "
the the , these the , they all .
in fact , it 's not real .
they work because they work us to work .
they 're us to be and , and in a way we 're not usually .
but it are not shortcuts .
that 's how things happens to memory .
one thing i want to do you is something that i 'm through , which man who does n't have to be remembered , learned , our lives are our lives of our memories .
how much are we willing to lose our lives , our , instead of telling us to us , how much are we ready to because we are so lazy that we do n't have the and ?
i learned that memory , in any of us , has incredible tremendous .
if we want to live a life , we have to be the person who do n't remember .
thank you .
at the age of 27 , i went to a job in the the of a the , and teaching .
in public schools in new york i was to for the .
as every teacher i , i and tests and
i was homework .
when the work , i , i grades notes .
in the , the only difference between the best difference between the best and worst .
the 's some of my students were not the .
some of my kids do n't get special good .
that 's me .
in the same , in , is difficult is : numbers , the , a area of a .
but no way n't these concepts , i found that convinced that all my students all students all the students , they could do hard and hard enough .
after some years , i went to the conclusion , we had a lot of understanding for understanding students and learn from a perspective of motivation , from a psychological perspective .
what we do is in the best measure is the natural , but what if in and in life , life much more than the ability to learn and easy to learn ?
so i left the classroom , and a to .
i started kids and adults in all kinds of different situation , and always wondered , who i am , and why ?
my , and i went to the west institute .
we were trying to what the would be the , and which would n't .
we went to national and , and the would be would be .
we studied the that worked in very tough very , and asked them to teachers the of the , and they were able to improve their students .
we were partnerships with , and , who were to their , and they could find their the .
and who would make the most money .
in all these different ways , the evidence of an individual and is .
it was not social intelligence .
it was n't good , physical , it was n't .
it was brilliant .
and is and for very long term .
it is the .
and is when you 're a , not just a week , a month , but for years , and really hard to work to plan .
it 's is like a marathon , not a .
i started in school in chicago .
i asked thousands of students the of the , and they and then they would come over a year to see who was made of the .
it showed that kids with kids were kids to the more difficult , even if i can all the properties things like , results , even tests , even as they did in the school .
so , is not only not in and , but also in school , especially for children .
the issue about this topic is that for me , that we know so much that science does n't know how much as you do .
every day , my parents ask me and teachers , " how do we study kids of children ? "
how did i teach a look at ?
how do i do it for ? "
the answer : i do n't know .
what i know is that you do n't have to be done .
our data show that a lot of people are not going to remain to .
in fact , in our , not necessarily not necessarily not , but it 's also talent with talent .
so far , the best idea that i 've been to the of , is called the the .
this idea was been at stanford university of stanford university and the that the ability to learn to learn not to be able to change their .
dr. the showed that kids when they read about the brain and learn how it 's to the challenges and challenges and challenges , much more likely to do it much more because it 's not a failure condition .
this is posture is a great idea for the of .
but we need more .
i want to finish my finish , we 're already so far .
that 's the work that 's us .
we need to best our best ideas and .
we have to do whether we succeeded successful , we have to be willing to have to , to have to lessons and from to .
in other words , we need to see kids to kids .
thank you .
in the center of my work is the connection of our to and part of the environment , where architecture from the natural , local conditions and traditions .
today , i 'm like example , i 'm a example , projects .
both of projects are in , in ethiopia and one of tunisia .
they also have common that the different from different perspectives are a part of the brain of architecture .
the first example started to a invitation , a the - in a in - capital .
this is the kind of building that we us , my team and me , as an example of what we should be shown .
first i thought i wanted to .
after we saw some of these buildings -- there 's lots of the city -- we that they have three of .
first , these are these buildings , they 're very large , they 're very large , where people do n't afford to buy things .
second , need to do is much energy because surfaces are glass , which is inside , and then you need a lot of the .
in a city where not should happen , because they have pretty the weather that 's been 25 to 20 25 .
and thirdly , their nothing with and ethiopia .
this is a place in a place called a rich culture and tradition .
and also , i was really the first really of the old the old market with this old market with where these people , and thousands of people , and to , in every day .
it has also this idea of space that uses the uses - activity to create activity .
so i thought , that 's exactly what i really want to design , not a .
but the question was , how we could create a the - building with these principles .
the next challenge came to when we were to this , because it 's in a city town of the city , where most of the buildings you were sitting on the picture , there were n't there .
it 's between two that have over hundreds of meters .
first , we created a connection between these two streets , and then there all the the of the building .
this is a - a - that creates a that creates a building in the building itself its own shape and its sun and .
and to take this , we this idea of a little with a little that every in every , because of the shape of the change , change .
i also think , how do we like to building the buildings ? how do we use the ?
i really wanted to find a solution to the local .
i started thinking about think like a out of concrete in the that which the air , and the light , but in the form .
and then i this new buttons in the the .
they have the properties of a geometry , and that helped me to the entire .
we 're building this with little , the windows that air and light on the into the buildings .
and that 's going through these little , the bits that light the light from the of the to the building the building .
it was n't simply the to with this ideas , because they thought , " this is not a not - , - did n't have . "
but then we realized that this idea is the more of a idea of the idea of a , because they can sell more .
and the concept of the was a much , not a lot of the material compared , but it because we had n't need to clean conditioning .
so we created some the of that we used to use this project .
the first time was to think about how to make the building buildings , in a city that almost every day .
we created a contribution by taking on the roof .
and under those the , we this as a new space , with space and , which that this .
these the on the roof , the water to the into the .
hopefully at the next year , because we have the to 5 .
the second example is a the - 2000 - in and in .
so to be a big project the project i had ever designed , i had to understand the city of really , but also the environment , tradition and the culture .
and this analysis i particular on the , which is the 1,000 - old structure that was from a wall , through 12 through , through and by the way .
when i was to the , the first step to the streets of the to create the first 12 of with large size and like the in and other cities with these the .
so , in addition , we some points in the into the into the concept of this , and they leave with lines , and the changed the pattern .
the last step was thinking about the cell , the entire cell of the project , as the as the as a part of the the .
what would the best in a climate for a apartment ?
this is the , because the of the between the two the that created , and created a natural the .
so we a pattern about the that the most that most of the most are perfectly in this direction .
and that 's the result , it 's almost like a combination of a european and the arab city .
there are the blocks with the and in the , these are all sorts of things .
it also local that , which is higher density to the upper and a lower density in a whole .
it also the concept of the .
the volume has this shape form that has evolved through three different of , and also to very dense light into the ground , there are three different of , like a and a kindergarten and a nearby of a of the that
the roof , my project in this project , the community 's almost the space to the building .
there can all neighbors and things and make things like a the on the morning , from a building to another building .
these two examples have a common approach to the brain .
they 're in emerging , where you can see the cities literally .
in cities , changes the architecture of architecture in the and future life people local communities and as buildings .
and that reason , i think it 's important to architecture , but solutions , the solutions that the relationship the relationship between the community and the environment and the to nature and connecting .
thank you very much .
i want to talk about trust , and i want to talk to you about the opinions .
they 're so ubiquitous to they become the .
there 's a view of my view .
first of all : trust is a in the , many .
then we goal , we should trust .
and a task : we should build the confidence .
i think the goal and the challenge is to wrong on false ideas .
i want to give you a different story about a claim , a goal and a better approach to the .
first of all : why do people think that is more ?
and if i really talk to my talk , i know , i do n't know the answer .
maybe it in some , or some , or some , in some of .
i 'm not going to be .
but i can look at the surveys of the that the are the source of faith , that it 's a .
look at a look at a period of a , is not a lot of to .
and will be people who people who were 20 years ago , mainly and , and still .
and the people who was very , very , still very , : , nurses .
we 're other people between the , and the almost in the middle .
but is that a good proof ?
the - -- .
what could you do that ?
so you look at the general attitude of people when you 're going to be certain questions .
trust politicians ? trust ?
now , if you ask somebody asked , trust , you trust ?
trust it 's ?
trust it 's ?
and then would you 'd probably ask , " well , " ? "
and that would be a reasonable response .
and if you understand the answer to you , you might say , " i 'm going to you some of you , but not . "
totally rational .
in short , we 're trying to live in our short lives , we 're in different ways .
we do n't think of it that we every of a or in a or in a .
so i could say about that i was given a particular , first grade , the first class , the , class , but i would n't want to go to the .
maybe i know i know that it 's not going to be good car .
i 'm that my friend a on , but not n't notice that secret .
simple .
so know how we know from our everyday ways , how different can look , but why do we know this knowledge if we 're thinking about trust ?
the situation are doing very well about the actual system , because they ignore the sense of the , that you 're in .
second , we get to .
the goal is to trust more .
honestly , i think i think the is stupid .
i would n't going to be that .
i would try to trust the more confidence , but not n't .
i 'm not allowed to do it to trust .
and those who have your their into hands of a certain event who would like the name , so that made out of the dust , " he , " i , i think , " much , much more confidence .
" trust , is not a the goal in this life .
trust and faith and be should be the goal .
and then you say , yes , okay , what is the most important is not , but it .
the people from humans .
and to do that , we need to look at three things .
are you ? are you honest ? are you ?
if we can get a person in the topics , and , and , we have a good reason to trust , they 're .
but the person 's probably not , probably not .
some of my friends are and , and i would n't want to letter you letter , because they are the .
i have friends who are very in their own , but they 're , but they 're .
and i 'm very happy about that i did not have a lot of friends that are and , but are .
if you have , i did n't even have it .
but after that , we only , trust .
trust is the response .
the we have to do that , of course , that 's hard .
over the last decades , we 've been trying to design the - all - all kinds of treatments and experts and experts and that it 's easier to make us .
many of these systems have the effect .
they do n't work like .
a the said once said to me , " the problem is that the would longer be free than the baby to the world . "
everywhere in our public lives , our institutions , our institutions , this problem , this is to this and , but it leads to the opposite .
it 's how people are their tasks by taking them .
i can , can any of .
so 's what 's going to .
the goal is more , and that 's difficult to be if we want to be , and want to want to communicate and other , and if we want to whether people are , or politicians ,
it 's not easy . you have to do it . simple reactions or not do n't know .
and now to do the task .
this is the to describe the of the , the .
because it suggests that you should trust and i trust .
we can do that for ourselves .
we can win a little bit .
so , people can improve people to improve their .
but ultimately , it 's a by being that by being done by one .
you ca n't build the what other one .
you have to give you a give you a confidence .
so you have to be .
and that 's , of course , you do n't usually people to at the nose at the nose .
but they also need to have older that they 're .
how does this ?
this happens happening every day , everywhere . people do doing , very effective .
here 's a simple example .
the store , i made my hate , she me up and ask them ask questions .
you take them back and give me back to me , or a couple of the in the .
that 's great . i 'll you , because you 've been shown to me .
there 's a morality of morality .
you think of the as , it 's a very good sense that you 're is , you to be your own words .
so our goal is not really to very difficult .
it 's relationships between people , and the the , and when the other is different .
so the morality of history is so much more about trust , or about faith , or about the the or the , or , and lot more about and how you people , and evidence of the own .
thank you .
you know , the best thing i 'm most best for me , the films i can look .
i love my own my with my kids , and when my daughter was four years old , we 've together , " the " of " . "
the film has n't longer left .
her , of course , was the .
so she had a good excuse , a dress , and a the .
but if you look at this film often , you look at how he 's actually .
we live in the today and our children in a kind of a - a - size .
but " the was by .
he did n't have this trend .
it has 40 years to continue this trend , -- interestingly -- a different movie , which a guy from a and a guy with a girl a girl , they just like the of the .
you know what i 'm talking about , right ?
right .
well , there 's a big difference between these two , even several differences between the and all the movies that we 're today .
first of all , there are in " the of " very violence .
the monkeys are pretty aggressive , as the the .
but i think if the had inspired by the government today , the would said , " the , " the , you 're the of that we were been .
use your shoes to order to read the computers , and the evil of evil . "
but it 's not happening .
another point i 'm at the " visual of " is very unique , is that the and even more characters .
this is the first time when i was my daughter , star , " i was , was different .
i was also a .
he was at the time three years old .
he was n't invited to this that he was n't too young .
but he was the second child , and he was less than his sister .
so he 's a , and he 's the film , he 's a his mother , and , and i do n't think he 's going to what he was going on , but he 's it 's in .
and i wondered what he was doing .
did he the it courage , and ?
he the that a army a army to get the government ?
he 's that there 's only boys in the , and of course , who is that really cool , but during the time , so that the heroes with a and a the to the , the he was
and they compare this with the " of "
how does your the your to a good end ?
by all the the and a the .
this is the kind of world i my children my -- , right -- and not in the world , which is to , which is pretty much today .
why is there so much -- in the movies that are children for our children , and so few so the ?
there 's a lot of good about the impact that have on the boys of the boys , and you should read it . it 's very good .
but i did n't read this much lot about boys with this .
i know from a experience that the could n't the model that i could have to find the world of adults , and girls in girls and common .
i think there was this moment with the first kiss , when i really expect that the the starts to , because that ends up or right ?
i 've my mission , i the girl .
why do you see there ?
i do n't know what to do .
the movies are very to the and their heart , and there 's not a lot of space for other relationships and other .
it does almost like as a young animal is a and animal and if you 're a girl , you should better get your the .
there are exceptions , and i 'm going to be the of any of you .
but they give a message to the young to the boys that are not the .
they 're real to teach the girls how to the , but they show the boys not be how they to the .
there 's no matter for you .
there are also some women who are new stories , and write , and writing and are also , and they 're still the .
and the most common of all the of the animal is a after the other , and every single one of them , a young man or a two of two men who are friends , or a son and his son , two men who have
until you , many of you think -- this year when you finally the movie " the -- the the . "
i recommend him all of you . he 's on the internet .
remember , what the said , " the ?
" oh , i ca n't believe that has made a the . "
it 's very good . do n't take it that .
but as no one did n't like this movies , the has the .
i do n't know if you 've heard about it .
it has n't have n't really , and meaning , but maybe we 're going to start today .
the is a the and in the middle of the this conversation that she her with a girlfriend of the films of films that had seen .
it 's very simple . there 's only three questions you need to ask : there 's more than a character in the film , which is the and something ?
try to get that .
and talk about women in the of the time ?
and what 's in their entertainment is something else , the guy , they like ?
i mean . thank you .
thank you .
two women who exist and talk talking about anything .
this is what happens . i saw it , and yet i see it 's pretty much in the movies that we know and love .
in fact , i went to the week in a to a good movie , " the . "
you remember , a lot of the in the , great the , a general sense of what a good - .
it falls with the the .
i think that should n't be , because of the time -- i do n't know if you 've seen it -- but a lot of the ordinary in a message where men and women and women during the .
there are some good scenes that men in this deep , by the , and the great moment , one of the the , is to door and say , " you go bed ? "
this is some of hollywood .
so let 's look at look at the numbers .
in 2011 , under the 100 of , what do you think how many of these were actually in ?
11 . that 's not a .
it 's not so many of the number of women who we just in the congress , so that 's the good .
but there 's a number that bigger than this is and this is this space .
last year , the new york times published the government .
you that you 're saying that you 're saying that
one of five women in the united states that they 've been to live in their lives .
i do n't think that 's the fault of general .
i do n't think that 's going to do anything about anything .
i do n't think that and directly to do with something , but something more , but i hear this statistics , one of the things i think is a lot of the .
who are these guys ? what are they doing ?
what do you do n't learn to learn ?
take your story , that it 's the task of a male , the violence with violence and then the , which is a woman who does n't have friends and not talking about it ?
so let 's take this story ?
you know , as a parent that has privilege , a daughter , just like the same thing that we do , we 're this world and these statistics in and we want to them .
we have tools to how we the , and we hope hoping that help , but i 'm also asking whether 's going to be , when we 're at the same time , active or , our , to their .
the the is a means that we can do something very important and i 'm talking to the .
i think we need to do our new just a new definition of
the definition of the is already changing .
you read how the new york of the and the .
they 're going to mess .
our sons will find a way to adapt to new relationship , and i think we really have to show you that a is man is his sisters and on their side , and really the bad guys who are men who want to
i think we should find the to find movies that the , if we find them , and find the search that are the to the real people , and people and to and to say , and i 'm on side , they
when i was my daughter , who " who " wars , " you know what they said ?
the .
the and the and the .
what have these two common together ?
maybe it 's not just the most dress .
i think these two figures are experts .
these are the characters in the that more than others and their knowledge to with other people to help them to their potential full of .
and also , they leaders .
i like this kind of job for my daughter , and i like this kind of job for my son .
i want to do more tasks like this .
i want to tasks what my son said , " and go and " and tasks , which he should be to a team , maybe a team to get to be better and better people , and the of .
thank you .
i want to talk to you about the story of a the .
i do n't know his name , but they but his story .
he lives in a small village in south .
his village is near .
the drought of the poverty and the and the the .
and when there was nothing there was him , he left his village , and he walked into the city , in this case , the , the capital .
when he 's there , there no options , no jobs , no way .
at the end , he 's in a outside of the .
it may be a year , but nothing .
one day , he will be a by a man who would him , lunch for dinner , dinner , to the .
he 's this dynamic group young people and they give him a chance .
he gets a little money to buy new clothes to feed money and home to home .
this is him young .
he .
he starts to new a new life .
his life has a sense .
on a nice day in the , the , walk into a straight in the air .
this the with the was the the and group of young people had been the to have a with a with .
how could the story of a the that just to in the in the ?
he had .
he had an opportunity to focus on the future , and a it was the first opportunity to him .
it was the first thing to call him from a state that we call " the . "
and his story is always over again over the areas of the around the world .
it 's the story of the , the , the , in and something different than . "
young people are moving from the city , their , jobs , work , wealth , but young people do n't have a percentage of wealth .
often it 's the youth that are under the high - .
in 2030 , three are five of five in five cities in the cities .
if we do n't young people in the growth of cities , if we do n't have opportunities , they 're going to be the , the in the violence in violence and in the cities .
in my favorite , 70 percent of young people are under unemployment .
70 percent do n't have work , do n't go to school .
they do n't actually do anything .
last month , i went back to after the , and i went to the the , where hospital where i was born .
i remember , i was this hospital , and i asked , what if i would never be here ?
what if i was to the same condition of " forced ?
would i be become ?
i 'm not sure what i 'm going to do .
the reason was in this month was the fact , the of a young - for young leaders and entrepreneurs .
i was about 90 young leaders .
we got together and we a to solutions for the largest challenges of their city .
in the room , a young man , the .
he went to the university in university and was his .
there was no jobs and no options .
i remember , he told me that had a the , and frustrated was the perfect goal , member , and to be and other .
they 're people like him .
but this story takes another different .
in , the biggest obstacles are to from a to b , the streets .
23 years , the completely destroyed , so that the best thing is best .
and the , the opportunity and they .
he 's a .
he began to stop on the , could n't afford to afford .
with his family and his friends , he bought 10 and he and he and he , and he , and he was going to be able to get some of the next three years .
how do you tell this story from the other ?
what makes the difference ?
i think it 's his ability to a new opportunity .
it 's the the , and i think that the can be the means to be the means "
it 's the young people to do the economic opportunity that which they 're desperately .
you can teach young people to be entrepreneurs .
i want to talk to you about a young guy who i one of my favorite : the , a the .
he helped me to the of some young people who people on the summit , and to show them how to build and .
he 's actually the first the that has been seen since the , 22 years before until before was there , the the was that was that the that ship from the from the from the , when you wanted to the wedding .
when you ask someone , " when did you last time you ever seen the last time ? " then the answer was the of the that the during the , " never . "
so saw an opportunity .
he was a the with a .
he was a outside of and started to the and , and what he said , in the climate .
he started to take a with flowers , and , and the city around the city , and he was working on the of the first public parks in the last year .
there 's no public parks in the .
he wants to create a place where families and young people are together , and he says , he can teach the beautiful things about life .
just 's the , it does n't because it 's because too much water .
so the first step is to young people to inspire , and in this room , the had a huge impact on the other young people in the room .
they never had really thought about it .
they thought to work for a work or for government , but this story , its innovation , had a strong impact on them .
he the them to look at their city as a place of view .
he the them that they can be entrepreneurs to change the change .
at the end of the day , they had innovative solutions for some of the largest challenges of their .
they had local solutions to local .
the inspiration of young people , and the of a is a big , but young people need to their ideas .
they need and to develop her business and develop business .
they 're people with the resources that they need , they give them the support they need to ideas and they will going to create the for growth .
for me , for me , more than just a of a .
it 's about social .
the - selling sell not just flowers .
i think he hope .
his design is the , " when it created , the view of people to their city .
the 's the to who to help him to and the .
he gave them the chance to the the state of the " . "
these young businesses have a tremendous impact on their cities .
so my suggestion is , you to young people to get people , and their own innovations and you 'll talk about stories about flowers and " instead of " and "
thank you .
so during my childhood , my was one of my favorite the to the on the on the of , because my parents are , happiness .
but these are hard to find .
they 're from sand , barely .
but after a certain period , i had a .
i started seeing , and patterns that helped me , they collect .
and that was to find things that i think to a to of and the .
and when i started studying , realized , i realized that see that my eyes n't eyes with my eyes .
because suddenly , in egypt , my beach in a car of a miles , along the the , and my the grew up to the size of cities .
and that led me to use .
i had to see differently to see the past in a map .
i want to show you how we example we if we use .
this is a gentleman that went in the eastern called the .
and the appears , we use , but we 're it , and it with color , this is suddenly that suddenly .
what you see here is , the chemical changes of landscape through the and the .
what i want to share with you today is how we used to find a city that which the name , and for thousands of years .
the was the capital of the old egypt , as a long - year - , a rich in a , about years ago .
the , the is in the , and it 's very efficient because it 's in the middle realm of the arts , the architecture and architecture and religion .
and always knew that the of the would be somewhere by the of the , the two , the red , but in the massive .
this area is huge -- the area is four times three miles .
once the , the , the , directly to the the , and , as it moves , and , and towards the west , it 's the city .
so how do you find a city in a .
they 're to find to be the equivalent to find the needle in the , with eyes and eyes .
so we used to the - to - map a map of the landscape to see to see a , changes ,
where the of the used to be used .
but you see , and this is very interesting , this slightly the of , with the circle that we us as a possible position for the city .
so we worked with scientists to the , what you see here .
this is like the ice , just instead of the layers , change , change , you can , human .
in a depth of five , under a layer of ancient , we found a density layer from the .
this shows that this position for space , in five meters , we can produce more over several hundred years of the , to the to rich , to the to the to the that we existence .
we found the -- the , the , the and -- which shows that 's a has a .
it might not seem to look at much , but if you look at the the stones , which were used by the in the rich , you find these rocks .
so we found a density layer of the the that on the rich .
we also found evidence for a for the society , which shows that this is a very important city .
but there 's not a the , but we 're going to get back to this site , we 'll going to draw a map .
what 's important , we to work for young who are in the school , so they 're so to who can make great discoveries .
so i wanted to be my with my the from the middle of the , it was in the city of the years ago .
" knowledge sharing is the biggest of the .
there 's nothing in this in the . "
ted was n't 1984 .
ideas , but actually , 1984 about nothing long , long , from .
you can see that the .
thank you very much .
thank you .
i grew up in taiwan as a daughter of a , to my memories , my , the , the , and the form of the chinese .
and i was , i was fascinated by this incredible language .
but for a , you seems to as the great wall of china is going to china .
i 've been wondering how i this , so everyone anyone who have to interested in this complex , these understanding and .
i thought that was a new way of learning , to be .
since five , i learned every single every single every single in every single in every single .
in the next 15 years , i 've learned new .
because we have just have five minutes to have a and very difficult to be very useful .
a chinese the has about 20,000 .
you need just 1,000 thousand for a simple the .
the most important 200 you are to 40 percent of the simple to understand -- enough to enough , to understand the and the of the .
today , i start with eight to show you how the method works .
are you ready ?
open your mouth as possible until it 's .
it will be a " mouth . "
this person goes to a .
" human . "
when the the for fire , a " with a person , if he was saying , " help ! i ! -- and the 's is going to the of the , but i like this idea . you take the you
this is a tree .
" tree . "
this is a mountain .
the sun is . "
the moon . "
the the for " the looks like a the from the .
these eight are radical .
they are the the to create a variety of .
a human .
if someone else is , then it means " follow . "
and then , more , " and " and " a " a . "
if a human his poor , " he says , " it was so big . "
the person in mouth , it 's like .
he 's a " , " as a in the whale .
a tree is a tree , two trees are a for a " . "
three are represent for a " forest . "
and you put a under tree , and you have a " base . "
if you put up a mouth , it means " the . "
just to remember because is a is a is a is a .
remember ? fire ?
two black people are hot .
three fire together are a lot of " . "
they put the fire under two trees , it 's " . "
for us , the sun is the source of the .
two together . "
three together are together .
when the sun goes and the moon together , it means "
in the context , it 's be for the next day .
the sun goes across the horizon .
door . a in the door stands the " . "
you put a mouth in the door , it says , " ask questions . "
the , the . is somebody there ?
this person the from the door . " , " . "
the left is the woman .
two women are two for a " . "
so , in three women , this is called " the . "
we 've now 30 .
so with this method , you can put the words in the first eight words .
so the next group of eight are in with other words .
with a little bit of a , a few hundred , a child - old child .
when we can make these , we start to them .
for example , it makes mountain and fire , and so it 's a "
we know , japan is the land of the sun .
this is the sun with the " because japan because of africa is china .
a sun with the is called " the . "
a human being a to do ?
a japanese . "
the are the on the left are two mountains .
in chinese , it 's " , chinese , her political chinese in the dark of the mountains .
today , " . "
a mouth says , it says , " it . "
that 's the slide that reminds me of the stage , thank you very much .
