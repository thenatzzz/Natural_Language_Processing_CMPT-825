      "the concept of the was a much , much more . not just because of the material compared of glass , but also because we had no longer conditioning .\n",
      "so we created some the - that we used to project .\n",
      "the first time was to think about how we could make the building buildings , in a city that has almost every day .\n",

We ensembled three models which are seq2seq_E048.pt, seq2seq_E047.pt, and seq2seq_E046.pt with our origin model seq2seq_E049.pt. We collected all the translations from these models. We learned the weights contributed by each model by comparing the translation texts with the reference text (sentence by sentence) and counting the best one according to the highest BLEU score. After implementing the ensemble decoding, we got a BLEU score larger than 20.5 for the train dataset and learned the weights of each model as follow.\n",

    "For the default solution provided, the original code uses the conventional encoder-decoder model. However, for a sequence-to-sequence task like NMT, the major drawback of this architecture is that it can only work well on not-too-long sequences. For RNN-based models, the encoders face a problem of memorizing long-sequence texts and convert them into a fixed-length vector. Also, the decoders receives only one-way information from the last encoder hidden state which is a bottle-neck for NMT task.\n",
    "\n",
    "To improve this model, we can use an attentional mechanism which helps fix drawbacks of the classic RNNs by selectively focusing on parts of the source sentence for NMT with additional techniques like unknown word replacement, good decoding strategies like Beam search, and ensemble technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although we have not implemented Beam search, we believe Beam search could help improve scores further as Greedy search decoding strategy will get us only a suboptimal result. Also, context awareness models could help improve this model further as we can see in the translation that there are lots of repetition and wrong order of words.  "
