when i was in my 20s , i had my first the .
i was a and i was particularly in berkeley .
she was a woman named alex .
when the came up the first , she came up and she a , and she fell into the couch in my office , the her and told me , about .
and when i heard this , i was .
my , had a patient for a first patient .
and i got a woman in the people who wanted to talk about .
i 'll leave that , i thought i .
but i did n't have it .
with the stories that alex did with the back , it was easy to me just to head with head , while we 're faced the problems .
" 30 is the new 20 " , " alex , and as far as i did , i had right .
work came later , later came later , later came later , later came later .
people in the in the and alex , and i had nothing time .
but soon my was , my head , to ask .
i was going to .
i said , " yeah , you know , you 're with your with your , you with a , but she 's not going to marry . "
and there said my , " , " not yet , but maybe you 'll save the next .
and also , the best time to work on marriage , before they married . "
this is what psychologists call a call .
that was the moment when i realized that 30 was not the new 20 .
yes , people later to look at times as a , but did n't mean to do the the .
and this was alex , the , the , and we got there and we sat up .
and i realized that this kind of the , a problem with real consequences , only just for alex and her , but for the , families , and all of people in the .
at this point , in the united states 50 million people in the .
we talk about 15 percent of the population , or 100 percent if you say that nobody can achieve the without going to go through the .
if you , you 're in your way .
i want to see a few of you .
oh , yeah ! you 're all incredible .
if you work with somebody , the , loves , because of you , i 'm going to see you -- . people in the really are really important .
my , my are in people in the , because i think that every single million should know what psychologists , and the wisdom of the most of the most of the most things that you can do for happiness , maybe even
this is not my opinion . that 's facts .
we know that 80 percent of the moments , to age to 35 .
that means that eight of 10 decisions , experiences and experiences that make out of your life , make it , until you 're going to be ,
do n't you if you 're over 40 .
this group is going to be fine , i think .
we know that the first 10 years of a , on how much money is going to deserve .
we know that more than half of americans are married or with the future partner or a relationship .
we know that brain is going to be the second and big grow in the and for the , which means whatever you want to do , you now time to be doing that .
we know that the that during the more than the , and in the life and the of the women are with their peak and after 35 .
so in the , you were going to be over the body and the your possibilities .
when we think about the development of a child , we know all know that the first five years for years and are in brain .
it 's the time that the ordinary , life has a impact on the future .
but we hear about little bit about there 's something like , and our are a time for time .
but the people get n't heard in the .
the press talking about the the of the .
scientists call the a .
journalists , the the of people in the like " the " or " . "
that 's true .
so , as culture , we have the what the decade is the .
the , that things that things with a plan and little bit time .
is n't that ?
so what happens when you put someone in the head , and say , " you , you get 10 years to make a little bit of your life ?
nothing .
this person is the the and the and the the , and it does n't happen .
and so every day , people in the and or how your sons and daughters into my office and say something like , " i know , my friend does n't know good , but this relationship is not . i 'm just time .
or you say , " all , as long as i 've done it for 30 years , it 's all . "
but later , it sounds like , " my are almost , and i did n't have any the .
i had a better fortune when i had finished college . "
and then it sounds like this , " in my , like the journey . jerusalem .
all the had and fun , but then , 30 , the music was suddenly out and everybody started to .
i did n't want to be the only ones that i stayed , i sometimes i , i my husband , because he was in my in the . chair . "
where are the people in the ?
does n't do that .
ok , that 's easy to say , but does n't make mistakes , because it 's about much .
if , if you go to the , there 's a enormous pressure in the process , a , a city , a , and you have a two or two kids or two kids in a much more time .
many of these things are more and like , and just show it just and the and the , all the time in the .
the does n't mean to the a to buy a red .
it means that you can do the career you want to do .
you ca n't have this kid you can n't want to be able to or ca n't give you a child .
too many people in the and look at themselves and myself and say me , and say , " what , what did i do ? what i just ? "
i want to change what people do in the and thinking .
this is a story that shows how it can .
it 's the story of .
and my in my when she was 25 , she had to , she had a the .
she said she 'd like to work in the art or in the , but she had n't decided , she had been in the last few years .
because was cheaper , she lived with her friend who more than his .
and even though their were , were their years before they had worse .
they often in the , but then she would her and said , " your family could you do , but your friends . "
one day , very , at and almost , all the hour .
she had bought a bought , and she spent all morning , her deal , but then she came to the , which was called the words , " in the , " in the "
she was almost the when she came up and said , " who 's going to be for me if i have a car ?
who 's going to me if i have cancer ? "
i moment , i had to myself to say not to say , " i . "
but the real no music , really , to look .
a needed a better life , and i knew this was her opportunity .
i had a lot of my first time to just about how the in the .
and in the next weeks and months , i 've been three to anyone who anyone , whether , or , or should .
first , i told you , she had n't have any , she would be a very successful .
so i would i to you , you something that would be to .
power to do something you is investment , invest in something you might be next .
i knew n't know about the and no one knows how the future of work , but i know : the .
so now , time is this job international job , this , this the , which is try to try .
i 'm not the of the of the but the , who n't count , by the way , they do n't have any .
this is the .
i said to the , the , but what .
second , i said , the urban - is .
good friends are , to get to the airport , but the , the with people who are like , to what they what they think what they think about how they 're talking and where they work .
this new this new person to the of the outside of outside of the own .
new things are made " the , " friends .
it 's true : the half of the is not or not .
but the other half is not , and they have the .
half of jobs never have . if you 're your boss to your neighbors , your , your job , not a job .
this is not a . it 's spread information .
the last advice : what believed that you could n't choose the family , but the friends .
this was for her as she was , but as soon as soon as soon she would soon her own family , if you had a partner and family a family .
i told her , time , a new family , would be .
you might think that maybe it 's better , to 20 than 20 or 25 , and i agree to you .
but the you 're you or you live in your life , if everybody 's facebook on facebook , is not an progress .
the best time to your marriage , before you have a , and that means that the means of the in love in love in love to
your family , means , and the and what you do , and not , because it works , or anybody with the time that you 're just .
so what happened to do ?
we went through her and she found the brilliant of a the who in a different state in a museum .
this weak band to her , get a work .
and this gave her reason to her friend her she was her .
now , five years later , she 's the for museums .
she has a man who she her .
she loves her new and new family and she told me a map , said , " now the line is " in the , you do n't get enough . "
sounds the sounds like this , it 's all easy , but that 's what i love about .
it 's so easy to help them .
in the , like the planes , who just left the and to west .
and right after the , a little bit of the difference make a difference whether you can in or in .
this is true for the , the , or the , a good conversation , a beautiful , a very clear can have a tremendous impact for years and even over generations .
this is an idea that all of the that you know .
it 's so simple as i said to alex .
i 've the privilege of what makes such a day of everyday : the are not the new , so you on a lot of a , you use your own your own family .
do n't tell you what you did n't , not .
you 're going to live now .
thank you very much .
in the entire , it was always our goal to connect between us and digital information , the gap between our physical world and the world on the screen where we can our imagination .
and this distance is smaller , smaller and smaller , and now it 's smaller than a millimeter that 's a , and computers and for are become for every .
but i wondered , how would it be no limit .
i looked like what would look like .
first i 've this tool that i into the digital world , so if you focus on the screen , it to the physical character .
designers can put their ideas directly into 3d and surgeons and to the at the screen .
so this tool , the tool was so the .
but our hands still remain outside the .
how can we do with the digital with the digital information and the whole of our hands ?
at microsoft , i 've worked with my mentor the , computer , and a little room in the keyboard in a digital .
that a that screen that screen and screen can make the of fingers and face , and you can put his hands from the keyboard , put the and with the hands .
and windows and put a position in the room , you can just pick it as easy to you a book from a shelf .
then you can through this book and you and , and all this on the of the the .
architects can their hands both their hands and .
so in these two examples , we are going to digital .
but how would we take that once and the digital information ?
i 've sure many of you have already experience to articles online later .
but now you have to worry about it .
here i have a " the . "
and this view , you get through a head of your head or your the , if the system the geometry of our body .
this idea , i started thinking about to think about the not just in the space , but it make it , so that we can make them and feel .
how would a look like a future ?
in mit media lab , i 've with my the and my collaborators , and i 've been a .
now , in this case , this is like a tiny - in our world , which means that computers , and people can move this everywhere -- at least small little of .
effectively we have the gravity and the control and control the by cheap the , and these .
by adding the object , we it from the through the and time , and it 's possible to move movements and in the real world .
so example can be over by the , or the , or , and again , and in the real world .
students can use this to use complex concepts of physics and physics and physics and unlike a the or the , or a is a and experience that experience and it 's very powerful .
and yet , more than just what we have now in the computer , it 's to imagine how the of the world is even our everyday activity .
as you can , digital will not only us to just us , but to interact with us as part of our physical environment , we ourselves from our world .
today , we 've started starting by talking about borders , but if we remove the limit , the only frontier is our imagination .
thank you very much .
i was been to for two years to become a the , in china , china , in the 1970s .
when i was in the first grade , i wanted to get government to school for school , all the paid .
but my mother said , " no . "
my parents wanted me to become a .
after they the , they believed , they found that the only way to happiness is safe safer and good job .
it 's not important if i do n't like the job or .
but my dream was to become a chinese the .
i 'm that i on my piano .
a has a very to start with the start , so i tried to try to go to the .
i wrote even at the and the to the of a .
but the adult does n't give my idea .
the adults did n't believe it was seriously me .
only my friends were me , but they were also just as children as i as myself .
and i 15 years old , i knew i was too old to with training .
so my dream would never be true .
i was afraid of fear that i could only could to the rest of my life .
but that 's so .
so i had to look in my head , i could find another .
no one there to me ?
so i to .
i my the of with a book and a book of the the of the , " i was my in a , the the tradition , " by the book i learned to be done by the "
[ " the " ] [ " ] " from the ] the , i got in the united states and what books did i read first ?
of course , books that are in china .
" the good earth " is about the life of chinese .
it 's just not just as propaganda . i understood .
the bible is interesting , but odd .
but that 's a subject for another .
but the fifth commandment taught me a way of " , " you want your father and your mother . "
" honor " i thought , " that 's so different and much better than a . "
this was my way to and to and to the relationship to my relationship to my parents .
through with a new culture , i started reading .
this was a whole .
for example , i did n't really get this very interesting first because chinese students are with this .
it never occurred to me that china does n't have to be in the center of the world .
so a map tells something about personal .
the reading is actually nothing new .
in the academic world , it 's a the .
there are actually the like the and the .
comparison and a understanding of a .
so i thought , if you read reading in the research , why does n't live in everyday daily ?
so i began to read two books at the same time .
you can use people -- [ " franklin by the , " john " by david the , who was in the same event , or by friends with their experiences .
[ " we " from " the " -- " life is a the of the -- and i 've stories different cultures , like joseph the book , " joseph " ] and for example , had to three .
in were , the , the political events , political and nature .
in the they were all nature : , and social -- interesting .
if you turn a physical language , it 's fun to read the the of in the languages .
[ " the for " for a thomas called " the of the water -- the the of " the " rather than me in translation , i found out how much i can win .
i 'm to , i of , " happiness , " happiness " happiness " happiness " joy . "
" in " means " means " new mother . "
books are like an incredible , you have a connection to the people and the present .
i know that i never feel , or i 'm feeling .
a dream is really nothing compared to what many other .
i came to come to that it 's not the only purpose of a true . true .
his purpose is to get us to in , where dreams , where our passion and our happiness .
even a dream can be this purpose .
because of course , i 'm here today here today , happy , again with a purpose in life and with a lot of time .
you books always be with you .
thank you very much .
thank you very much .
thank you very much .
when i was eight years old , a new girl was in new class , the class , and she was so , as girls as a new girl .
she had the hair and a little the , was good at a and .
in the , i , until i until i had a the plan .
so i stayed a little bit longer school in school , a longer , and i was stuck in the the .
when the air was , i came into , i took into the classroom , i took the the of the the .
and then i did .
i the the notes of my the , just , just some few .
all of the .
when i wanted to make the book , i noticed that some of my other had to be pretty good .
so i in the all of all the , without .
i gave all of all , and i myself , because i was because i was also all the time .
i 'm still more about my behavior .
i do n't understand where the came .
i do n't understand why i did so good .
i felt really good .
i do n't even know why i never been to .
it was so obvious .
i was never caught .
but most of me , most of me , why is it so that this little girl was so good in
i 'm not happy .
it 's so , .
we know babies under .
similarly as primates . the are from nature from very .
we know that the of the is in among in the united states .
but i never a study that i could their or their or their .
so to do that , we need to the literature , because the novel is the lab in the in all their forms .
is it a to say that if we did n't have any , we did n't have no literature ?
so no the , no "
no the king , no " from " night . "
no shakespeare .
and , as the of the , we , " and " and " the great " , " the , " the , " the . "
no , no , no , . i know that it 's in to say that the has the answer everything has , but in the , he has really it .
this year , we this , the 's the , " for the long time , " and his analysis of the sexual - and the of the , my , that my thing we hope .
think , think , think , right ?
we think about the little boy to try to sleep .
we think about a piece of cake , in the .
we forget how the his vision was .
we forget how it is .
these are books are the kind of the as the as the .
i do n't know how the is , but let 's say it 's a .
let 's look at why the novel and the and the and the and so well .
is it so obvious that drive is -- , such a basis for a story ?
i do n't know . i think it 's just hard to the , because think , what happens when we 're .
when we 're a , we tell ourselves a story .
tell us stories about people 's lives and they make it bad , because they 're so that it 's bad .
as an artist of the , and the audience we know , which detail , to the into the . right ?
and we all to us , and so that 's the .
in the first band , " in world , the , one of the great , thinks about his care and , in the course of the , they 're as long , and he will go , " wait ! " i 'm going to
everything you give me and joy , might be somebody else , joy , even in this moment . "
this is the story that he tells telling , and from there to the to the that he 's a new , he 's in the his of his , his in his private the .
we 've got to admit that the and the are the .
and friends had have to leave the country if they want to with him .
but you do n't need to be to realize that it hard work . right ?
there 's a .
it 's a feeling that 's to be .
what does the ?
it 's like information .
i like the details .
the , the the of brown hair and little .
i like to photos .
so that 's why it 's so successful .
basically , the language of science and science .
when these the were the , suddenly out of the door , and the of his the of his the , he this behavior .
he says , " you think you 'll be that 's a , but it 's not nothing to a text , or a text , or a . "
he says , " there 's scientific worth value . "
and what 's trying to show us is that the is and makes us look at the core of her , and for the truth , the truth , and the truth , the , the better , the better .
now , loss , that 's for the way to wisdom .
he says , " a woman that we need to suffer us , us a greater and more than a man who 's interested . "
he tells us about that we should make women ?
no . i think he 's to say that he 's us to tell us about ourselves .
is there another different that we us in this particular way ?
and we realized that we feel our and our and more ?
we can see different with such with these kinds of sound ?
freud should be write about this .
one day was a was a by a very young man who was by the thought of his wife , him his wife .
and freud says , this man is kind of strange , because he does n't even know what his wife does .
because she 's innocent , and everybody knows that .
the poor creature is lower under the .
instead , he looking for his wife , no it ,
she too , she to with a man ?
[ freud ] says that the man is the of the of his wife .
the novel is very good at this point .
the novel describes very well , how much hard - us , but not the .
because the more we are , the more we it to us .
so i think that way that we do n't get to do things or illegal things .
i 'm to be very .
and i think about myself about eight years , but i also think about the story i heard in the news .
a woman from michigan was written , because she was by a self - the for a year , the messages himself
a year for a year .
she tried to get her new friend of her shoes into the shoes , and i to when i heard , i was with .
because ... let 's be honest .
what does it mean , if creativity , creativity , right ?
this is something from a novel .
this is something from a novel the .
the is one of my favorite .
she 's the most the and the woman of american .
from her , " two in the train , and the the mr. , " books how to -- to keep your mind , and we 're in the realm of the that the in between the in the and what might be
take tom the , your character .
first , all , tom , you have , and you have , and she has what they had once , and they 're like by the , and he 's on their name , he name their jewelry , he 's her .
this is a way .
but what do we do ? we ca n't make it as tom .
i ca n't give the world , even though i 'd like to do it for some days .
it 's a shame , because we live in a time .
we live in a live - era . time .
we are all good social media that are currency about , right ?
does the novel of the ? i 'm not sure .
let 's do what do , if you 're not sure if you 're in a of a .
let 's go back to the street and ask questions to the .
think of the , think of his the as professor , this great .
but i liked always [ ] , the boss of the with the face of a rat , the the needs , needs , needs , but it to him .
that 's me familiar .
so , needs his help , and it and the stories of stories of stories .
but as you start to start starts to something , and eventually in " the six , as the , and all of his solution , the the is to the and says , " we 're not the on them , mr. the .
we 're proud . "
and he 's that there 's no - to - the - , the n't want to shake the shake .
that 's one of the few times that we can see the in the stories , and i think this little very smart , but also 's a , .
it seems like not as an emotional , but a problem .
in a moment , a is a on a different like .
and the next moment , they 're on a wavelength .
suddenly , it 's to this , he has to him .
is it really easy ?
what if really was a really problem , if it was just about how we deal with the other in ?
maybe we would n't be to be the on the .
we could choose .
but i like the .
while we 're waiting for , we still have the literature as a .
literature alone , the .
literature alone , she can the , .
and who 's all the : the good news , the tom , the crazy the , the .
we are in society .
thank you very much .
i was about 10 years old and on a the - old with my father in my father , a the in the northern of the new york .
it was a great day .
the forest .
the sun would look at the petals like the the like glass , and if no have been , you would almost that we were the first people that are through these forest .
we came to our .
i saw the little hut on a cliff and a across a the , beautiful , as something called me .
behind the roof , a one , maybe four - square , with the , the and a old the .
i was amazed , i was angry and i was confused .
the were lazy to the , what they had -- who were , would they would to ?
the question was asked me , and i asked them to them :
who we after us ?
how do you also or where " might be , who are behind us behind us in istanbul ?
who 's behind us in rio or in paris or in london ?
here in new york new york , the the of every day of day was tons and tons .
i wanted to them -- as individuals .
i wanted to understand who make the job .
how is it wear to wear a uniform and wearing it ?
so i started a with them .
i went to the , the and went to and went to offices and in the city , and i learned a lot , but i was still a fabulous .
i have to go deeper .
so i took a job as a the .
i did not just working with the truck . i was the .
and i was the mechanical the and the snow .
it was a remarkable privilege and a experience .
everybody asks after the .
he 's there , but not as you think , and on days , it really bad , you 're pretty quickly .
and you to the weight , you just hard .
i know people who were this number of years , whose bodies were still to weight her body , tons of every week .
then there 's the danger .
after statistics of the the , the is the job in the under the 10 of the jobs in the country , and i learned why .
you 're all the entire day , traffic , all over .
everybody wants to and often do n't have to be .
that 's really bad for the workers .
and the garbage itself is full of the that the from the the and terrible .
i learned about the the of the the .
if you look from the the , and from the of the city of a city , you can see that the is like a self - itself .
he does n't stop to .
it 's also like a kind of or .
he has to be in motion .
and then there 's the stigma .
you put the uniform and , somebody -- whatever -- whatever -- whatever you 're going to get you traffic or your a , or you 're going to close to your apartment , or you can and you and you and
i think this particular because i believe in the of the most important city on the streets of the city . that 's three reasons .
they 're the of the health .
if you do n't waste the waste , every day and efficient and , it would take out of the the and the and the would continue to us on very .
diseases that we 've been achieved for decades and , and would spread and us .
the economy needs it .
if we ca n't do the old stuff , we do n't have a place for the new , and the motors of the to start to the , the is the is the .
i do n't not know the capitalism , i 'm just going on the .
and then that 's what i call our , .
and i 'm just by just how fast we 're now today .
we do n't care about ourselves , our , our or our , or , or .
we take them , throw them away , forget , because we know people on the other side that are care about .
so i want to share today some ways today , how to think about how to think about the and them into this conversation , how you create a city that are sustainable and .
your work , i think , is kind of the .
you see the streets every day , regularly .
they carry in many cities .
you know when you expect to .
and your work does make us do our .
they 're like a .
the that they , us ourselves before our , our the , and this has to be more and to any price .
on days after 9/11 , 2001 , i took the of a the on the street , and my son and son and the and there was a man who drove his , he was doing it .
and i tried to work him for him work -- that day , all day days , but i started to cry .
and he looked at me and just looked and said , " everything 's fine . "
" everything is fine . "
it was n't until later started i started my research and the the .
his name is the , and we worked together , and we finally got good friends .
i wanted to believe that the was right .
everything is fine .
but in our efforts , change the way we on this planet as a planet , we need to look at the cost of the cost , including the very cost of the work .
and we have to be informed to help people who do this work , how we think about how to systems about , which is a tremendous success of the united states and countries , and to us to a different species of waste that are can be transformed by
the more fundamental , we think about when we talk about power , three percent of the national .
it 's a remarkable statistic .
in your daily , in your lifetime , if you see next to see somebody whose job is to make them , take a moment time you 're .
take a moment to get to .
hello , hi , what goes ?
that 's not enough .
hello , what is ?
my name is the , and i 'm not drunk , but the doctor in my birth .
he 's six my six directions , and me little , the air .
so i what i learned , what i means i 'm going to do all the time .
look at that .
it 's a . i 'm a of the , the and .
not is n't genetically .
it 's not a the . you ca n't get it .
nobody has the of my mother 's , and i did n't get it because my parents are so afraid what they are .
you get through accidents , like the day my birth .

my father taught me to walk when i was five , by using my feet on his feet and just the .
another of his was to a of my front of my nose , so i 'm going to get them .
my inner was very strong , and as -- yeah , on the first day in kindergarten , i was like a who had a .
there was only six only in my city , and all my family were all my family .
today we have 20 in the city , and they 're still all my family .
i think no one has ever noticed that we do n't have a .
this was before 9/11 before and before it took it for a , " i hate to use as a .
the people i had with up with no , no problem with my faith .
but they were very concerned that i could possibly maybe could .
i explained that i was to live by three months three months , so the from to the to a .
i have the .
yes , on , it 's crazy .
my parents could n't afford to afford , so they sent me to the .
i learned how to build on the , so i can walk on .
and i 'm from the , where it really important to be , so if my friends were married , i also .
and if my friends were their off on the coast of the , i do n't .
i spent my summer in a summer because my parents were afraid that we if we go to every single summer , one day , day .
the the often that my dad wanted to me , so i used to milk of the , and into the dead sea , and i know how the water in the eyes and i thought , " it worked ! it worked ! "
but we found a the , : .
i have to say it 's really boring , but before i did , i was a - old , who ca n't even stand .
now i can stand on head .
my parents always me that i would be able to make sure that not was not impossible , and my dream was to be the general . "
because of the , i got a great scholarship on the university of the who had the university state , because i every minority of .
i was kind of the the of the .
all loved me .
i do n't like all of the homework , so , all of all of my classes , getting in all of these .
every time i a scene from " the the , my teacher .
but i never got a role .
so in my the , the , the piece of a piece of " the dance " dance , it 's .
a piece of a girl with .
i was a girl with .
so i everywhere , " finally , i get a role !
i have a !
finally !
thank god , thank you , i 'm free ! "
i did n't have the role .
the brown had got the role .
i was the to the of the , i the , when someone had my cat , and she asked why she said me , she told me that i would n't going to do the .
i said , " sorry , but if i ca n't , if you ca n't do the character . "
i was born to this that , and she gave them a without a .
college the life .
hollywood is known to physically healthy .
after i went back to my first role was as a the in a the .
my dream was true .
and i knew that i was soon to " the "
but instead , i had a the that was just the only , and realized that the did n't have a , .
they only perfect people .
but i 'm afraid of the rule .
i grew up with the , the and the , and all of these women had a common : they were the .
so i became a .
my first job was to famous york city from new york city new york new , and i 'm never going the face of the first time i ever , forget , he realized that were to the streets to new jersey with a the with a the
i am in all across the united states , i 've also been in the east , and the .
some people say , i 'm the first - in the arab world .
i do n't want to ask the first , but i know that you never heard about the bad little bit that women are not , and they find us .
2003 , my brother from a mother and father , father , the , and i was the new yorker new american the that now have to be the .
our goal was to the negative image of americans from in to change the media and to the , that the and not .
the of the was much than the challenge against the stigma of disability .
my great breakthrough was in 2010 .
i was been to the in the the " the " the " the . "
i was like to the the the , and she 'd me into a studio and i sat on a chair .
so i looked at the , and said , " sorry , i get another chair ? "
and she looked at me and she said , " five , four , three , two ... "
and we were live !
so i had to make the table on the table , so i did n't get the from the screen , and when the interview was finished , i was me .
there was my chance , and i had her , and i knew that i never me back .
but mr. the invited me , but he made me a to an the and my chair .
working with work with keith , i learned , all the internet on the internet .
people say , kids are cruel , but as a child or adults , or never been me about me .
in the world wide web , i 'm with my of the .
when i look at online , i see like , " the , why this like ? "
" the , is the the ? "
and my favorite : " the .
did it have ?
we should be for them . "
even , my disability into the the : the , the , the , the .
a disability is as visible as it 's like .
if a ca n't play a video game , ca n't play a play .
the are the biggest -- yes . that 's a worth value .
people are the largest minority in the world , and we are the most in the .
the doctors said , " i never walk , but i 'm sitting here .
but i would be with social media , i would n't be here .
i hope that we can take together a picture of in the media and the .
maybe there 's no way at the internet that if there were more positive to more positive .
or maybe not .
maybe it 's still a village to a good .
my journey has led me to a very special places .
i put on the red next red next to the and the the .
i was in a film with adam the and with my , which is amazing by .
i 'm as a the with the the " the " around the world .
i was a huge the of the new jersey in the national center .
i 've been a the 's " , a , who 's trying to give the to the chance of a chance that my parents my me .
but the one moment that the most -- before this -- the moment that i when i first before the man , how a and a like a bee of the , the way , and i 'm , .
this was the only time that my father ever a of me and i was going to talk to this talk .
: god your soul , your dad , dad . my name is the , " if i can , you can . "
there was a time we 've been big problems .
on the 21st , july was the from the apollo and was the on the sea of the ocean .
armstrong and the were alone , but their presence on the top of the was the peak of a the , the .
the was the largest in the history of the united states of america .
to the moon , it 's about billion dollars worth of worth , four or four percent of the .
apollo created for 400,000 people and the the collaboration of 20,000 companies , universities and universities .
people died , including the of the apollo .
but until the end of the end , 24 people to the moon .
from the that its surface , is the , after death of the last year , now the oldest .
why did they go ?
they did n't go back , and the of the , and , and something which all the 24 later -- a new sense of that our home is small and small .
why did they go ? the , they went because president had wanted to show the name that his nation had the better .
but the on words on a university of the university of a .
for the , was n't just a victory of the west over the east during the cold war .
at the time , this was a feeling of the of technology .
it was a to the moon because it was something great .
the the - in a long - of series of technological the .
from the first half of the 20th century , the and the and the and , and a vaccine against .
in the middle of the century , polio and smallpox .
technology seemed to something that what 's called the a " the . "
for most of the human history , we could n't even faster than a horse or a boat with a , but in the year , the apollo was 10 miles per hour per hour .
since 1970 , no human have been on the moon .
no one has ever faster than the of apollo , and the optimism is about the power of the technology is , because the big problems we had to technology , to clean , or the world the world , seem to seem
i remember as a the as a the .
and the of the apollo 17 , and my mother me not to very the in the the .
i had a idea that this was the last final , but i was going to be that there was still alive in my life .
the the " something with our ability to be big problems with technology to become a .
you hear it everywhere .
we 've heard it in the last two days ted .
it 's a that if us had us to and ourselves themselves with , with things like things and social media and social media , or algorithms , the .
it 's nothing wrong with most of these things .
they have our lives and .
but they do n't solve the big problems of humanity .
what happened ?
there 's a explanation silicon where you 've been that in recently , we 've been doing more than in the years , intel , microsoft , apple and apple .
in silicon valley , you are used to be , in particular , the the , the company companies .
silicon valley says that the are moving from other to ideas , to and even problems .
but this explanation is not good enough .
it explains mainly what does n't silicon with silicon .
even their times , they were tiny , tiny , a 10 years within 10 years .
investors had always been to invest in technologies like energy , which is a carbon and development and development and , never ever been the development of technology that have no value .
no , the reasons why we ca n't solve a big problem , complicated and more .
sometimes we decide not to the big problems .
we could fly to mars if we want .
nasa , even has a plan .
but to be a political decision of public , and that 's why it will never happen to
we 're not going to fly to mars because everyone thinks that there are be there on earth 's things that are done .
another time we ca n't solve the big problems because our political systems are fail .
today , less than two percent of the earth 's earth , from sources , solar wind , wind and wind , less than two percent , and the reason is very small .
coal and gas are cheaper than solar wind and wind and efficient is cheaper than the .
we all want to alternative that can keep the , but no exist .
now it 's so , and all of all the same opinion , what national and international development , and mainly : mainly , in the development of development and development and a price for carbon .
but in the current political climate , there is no hope that the u.s. of the u.s. or the international the international the these the and .
sometimes are more complex problems that technically , but not so .
it 's been believed that the is going on the .
but 30 years of research have taught us that political impact .
technologies can things like systems or systems like systems and , and it 's going to be famine , as long as there are .
eventually , large problems sometimes the solutions because we do n't understand the problem .
president was the war of war , but you discovered what discovered that there are many kinds of cancers , which is of the of the , and only for the last 10 years , is going to be effective .
difficult problems are difficult .
it 's not true that we ca n't solve the problems with technology .
we can , we have to have to have these four elements all the first of all politicians and politicians must be involved to solve a problem , have to solve the solution ; it needs to be a problem , and we have to understand it .
the that led to a kind of metaphor for the ability to solve , to solve big problems ,
but this is a model which ca n't happen in the future .
it 's not the year .
there 's no the struggle like the cold war , no politicians like john 's , everything and to a power , and no sense of the like the of the solar system .
but in the , it was just end up to the moon .
he was only three days .
and it 's really that 's really a serious problem .
we are ourselves and the solutions of the future will be to be harder .
god , it does n't be us to challenges .
thank you very much .
i want to you to close your eyes .
imagine you 're going to your .
look at the door , their color and the material made out of them .
now , you a group of the - on their front .
it 's a the - , and you come up and you and your .
you to this .
they 're down , and , and you on .
and then they all directly into your town .
bicycles , wheels , all the cross and the , and the in the .
now , you have about the threshold of your in your , or what 's on the side of your brain , and , as the in the room .
the light seems to the .
it 's you from your desk 's a horse .
one horse .
you can almost feel like his blue gets your nose .
you the the the that it into the mouth .
go over to him , over in your living .
here you want to be your .
her clothes just the , she , " she had always touched a , while she 's on your the .
now , i 'm going to your kitchen .
the floor was replaced by a yellow the , and it made out of a beautiful , the the , the and the of " from the " of " , " , " hand , hand .
okay . now , open eyes .
i want to tell you about a very competition , year every year in new york city .
it 's called " the . "
a few years ago , i wanted to talk about this of as a the of the and , who was the the of the the of the .
it was a bunch of new and some few of a few of and .
they 're looking at hundreds of numbers hundreds of numbers .
the learned of the names of and the of the of and
and it whole thing in just a few minutes .
they were the about who the of a of a the - the .
this is crazy .
these people have skills .
i started to talk to some of them .
this is ed , a guy who was from england , and there 's one of the the .
and i asked him , " ed , when did you notice you have this particular ? "
and ed said , " i 'm not a the .
i just have a average memory .
everyone who 's here , will tell you that she has just a .
we 've all , we , techniques , to these incredible techniques , which is the two years ago , the same techniques that used to his to and to the to books .
and i thought , " wow , how is i never heard of it ? "
we stood outside out of the the and ed , this wonderful , brilliant , and something funny said , says to me , " josh , you 're a american journalist .
you know , you ? "
i said , " what ? what ? why ? "
" i 'd like to teach the the of how to get a order of a the - the .
it would be the world prove that everybody can . "
i told him , " i 'm not , but i but i could teach me .
i mean , you 've got to start somewhere , right ? "
and that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me .
so , i 've spent a lot of the next year , i not just to my memory , but also to it and understand how it works , why it does n't work and what could be .
i have a lot of really interesting people .
this is for example , for example , is example .
he 's suffering under the , and probably the worst memory of the world .
his memory is so bad that he 's n't even be his the . what 's amazing .
although though it was so tragic , he it , it how much our us who we are .
on the other side of the spectrum , i learned to the side .
the the is the .
he was the most of the the character in the movie " . "
we spent a afternoon to the public in lake city .
and i came back to a whole of over the memory , two years ago , and in the in the in the , and later in the .
and i really learned a whole bunch of interesting things .
and especially me , there was a time to the to the , not nearly as much as the as today .
there was a time when people were in their memory , it 's a .
over the last few decades , we 've a series of technologies -- from the to the , to the the , the , the computer , the smartphone -- the it -- it makes us easier to our , human ability to
these technologies have our modern world , but we us at the same time .
they 've changed us and i would argue that they 've also changed us .
without the need to remember , sometimes it 's like we forget .
one of the last places of this earth , you still find people who still are passionate , and , and , and that is unique .
in fact , it 's not unique , there are like this around the world .
and this has me the , i wanted to know how these guys do this .
a few years ago , a university at university london group of a brought into the lab .
they wanted to know : is the structure or the of their brains differently than the rest of us ?
the answer was : no .
are you smarter than we ?
she gave them a the , and the answer was , was n't really .
there was a interesting and a interesting difference between the brain and a the a brain and a that was compared .
if you put them into a the and , your brain , as you can imagine , faces and pictures of pictures of you can see that the regions of regions of the brain than the rest of us .
it seems like you 're using the part of your device that uses up using the and used .
why ? and can we learn from something ?
the to the memory of memory is a by a kind of a - that every year , every year to a new technology to the a more of more and more and more and the rest of the rest .
this is my friend ben the , the .
on the table , front of him , 36 of the the , he himself within an hour with an technology that he invented and as a .
it 's a technology around the of the in order of 140 , the , in a half an hour .
yes . yes .
and even though it 's a of techniques to put things together in these the , but they all created the techniques on the concept that psychologists called the .
this is so the about this concept , this is a very wonderful thing : follows : if i ask two people , the same word , and i say , " the , " it 's a person called a . "
this is his name .
and i say , " you , there 's a person who 's a . "
now , if i go back to a moment now you back to you , and say , " you the word i 've ever been before you before you ?
you know what you 've done ? "
the person who person the person who is the , remember more likely to remember the word of the word who person who person who person the person .
same word , things the , ; it 's weird .
what 's going on here ?
well , the name of the means is nothing .
he 's absolutely all of all the the that in your head .
but the profession of the , we know .
so white the .
so , have a on their hands .
so smell good when they come home .
maybe we may even know a .
and when we hear that word first , we 've got this whole with the word and the it later that later .
the secret of what going on in the , and the secret to be able to realize things that you can find the of the into the , a that no matter what meaning in meaning in sense in sense ways , meaning
one of the most techniques can 500 two 500 years back to the .
she was known as the known .
and the story of his story : there was a poet called the , who was a the - .
he was a conversation for the conversation , because when you really wanted to really a really big party , you do n't want a the , but a poet .
he 's his poem from the memory and the room , and the moment , the moment , the up behind me and all the .
not only all dead , your bodies are to the the .
nobody can tell anyone who was , nobody knows where who has .
the body can not be properly .
it 's an tragedy after the other .
the 's outside , the only way of this , he 's his eyes and suddenly he can see his front eye , where i where i .
and so he takes the the of the hand and it causes it the .
in this moment , something we all know that we do n't know how much bad we , we have , or , of our of our colleagues , we have a very good and memory .
i would like to ask you to first the first 10 words of the story about the , so you find it hard to find it hard .
but i bet if i ask you to remember , who remember who 's sitting on a moment - horse in your horse , your , then you might have the .
the idea of the is to create a building of inner eye and it with the of the things that are -- the , the , the , the , the more of it as it 's .
this is a advice that on the over two years old , about the memory .
so how does it work ?
you 're invited to you to talk to ted talk you want to keep it out of the , as it would be done , he would have been the to over two years ago .
you 're like to imagine you imagine you want to imagine your .
imagine a secret crazy and crazy story with pictures of , to remind you that you first about this about crazy talks , about emotional .
and then you put your house and you hit the back on the back of mr. .
and that would remind you to come back to your friend ed .
and if you look at color , you to a that you to tell .
you put into your kitchen , and the fourth thing you to talk about this was journey to you for a year , and you 've got friends you to remember you remember . remember .
so you know , this research did n't -- not word for word , word , but to subject on topic .
the english term " the , " which is the theme sentence , comes from the greek word " . "
these are some of those people when people about and in terms of .
the " first , " in first place . "
i this was just fascinating and i 'm still a fascinating and i 'm just
some of the other 's risks .
i wanted to write something about this the of the the .
but there was a problem .
the problem that the are the - are - are .
it 's like a group of people who sit sitting and write a test .
it 's already exciting when somebody who are the .
i 'm journalist , i need something to write about .
i know that the things in the people in the people , but i do n't have access to it .
so if i wanted to tell this story , i had to me to their position .
and so i began to get every morning every 20 minutes 20 minutes before i started with my newspaper , to something .
maybe a poem or maybe a poem or a poem .
the name from a old the that i bought on the the .
i had to make it was much fun .
i could never imagine .
it has fun because it 's not about to memory .
you 're always better , these crazy , and hopefully images from your mind 's eye .
i 'm at it .
here 's me with my the .
a few of and a the that were up to two small year , because the greatest enemy is the enemy .
i went to the same conclusion that i had a year earlier , i had a year earlier .
and i 'm interested in this , just as an experiment .
it could be a nice - for my .
the problem was that the experiment did n't like .
i won the , which , which really should n't have .
it was nice to and , and , and , but that was n't what i wanted to do .
these are just tricks .
tricks the work because they work on some simple ideas about the the of our solar system .
you do n't have to build a - or - or - to - to - to - to - to - how to can to the .
we often talk about people with people , as if it 's a special , but that 's not true .
good are the .
we 're going to better things when we look .
we remember we 're getting .
we , if we have the possibility of figure out why information and experiences are to us , why they have meaning and , and if we can them into something that we can sense of our senses , and we can call the "
the the , these the , they all .
in fact , it 's not real .
they work because they work us to work .
they 're us to be and , in a way that we 're not usually .
but there are not shortcuts .
that 's how things to memory .
one thing i want to do with you is something i 'm through by the , the man not n't be remembered to his life , learned , our lives are the of our memories .
how much are we willing to lose our lives , our , instead of telling us to us , how much are we ready to because we are so lazy that we do n't have the and ?
i learned that the memory , in any of us , incredible .
if we want to live a life , we have to be the person who do n't remember .
thank you .
at the age of 27 , i went to a job in the the of a the , and teaching .
in public schools in new york i was to for the .
as every teacher i , i and tests and
i was homework .
when the work , i , i grades notes .
and in fact , the was n't the only difference between the best and worst students .
the 's some of my students were not the .
some of my kids do n't really well .
that 's me .
in fact , in the , in , in math , is difficult : numbers , the , the area of a .
but not n't these concepts these concepts , but i was convinced that all of my students all students all the students to learn , and they worked hard and hard .
and after some years , i came to the conclusion , i had to a lot of understanding for students and learning from a perspective of motivation , from a psychological perspective .
what we do is in the best measure is the natural , but what if in and in life , life much more than the ability to learn and easy to learn ?
so i left the classroom , and a to .
i started to kids and adults in all kinds of all , and i wondered who is successful and why ?
my , and i went to west .
we were trying to what the would be the , and which would n't .
we went to national and the to the children would .
we studied the that were worked in very tough in and asked , who were teachers to the of the , and they were able to improve their students of their students .
we were partnerships with , and , who were to their , and they could find their the .
and who would make the most money .
now in all these different ways of looking at an individual of an effective of success .
it was n't social intelligence .
it was n't good , physical , and it was n't .
it was brilliant .
and is and passion and for very long term .
it is the .
and is when you 're a , not just a week , a month , but for years , and really hard to work to plan .
it 's is like a marathon , not a .
i started in public schools in chicago in chicago .
i asked thousands of students of the , and the , and then they would come over a year to see who was made .
it showed that kids with kids are even more likely to meet , even if i can show some things properties things like , tests , even as they did in school .
so , is not only not just in the and , but also in school , especially for children with children .
the issue about this topic is that we know , little bit about the science as little how it .
every day , parents and teachers and said , " how do we study the children of children ? "
how did i teach to a ?
how do i going to for them for ? "
the answer : i do n't know .
what i know is that you do n't have to be done .
our data show that a lot of our people are not going to be able to do .
in fact , in our , not necessarily not necessarily not , but it 's also talent with talent .
so far , the best idea that i 've been to the of , is called the the .
this idea was to stanford by the and the belief that the ability to learn to learn not to change their change .
dr. the showed that kids when kids read about the brain and learn how to and how it changes and how to change and , much more likely to do , because they do n't believe that failure is a state condition .
this posture is a great idea for the .
but we need more .
i 'd like to finish my finish , we 've already so far .
that 's the work that 's us .
we need to best our best ideas and .
we have to do whether we succeeded successful , we have to be willing to have to , to have to lessons and from to .
in other words , we need to be able to give kids .
thank you very much .
in the center of my work is the connection of our to and part of the environment , where architecture from the natural , local conditions and traditions .
today , i 'm as example of example , projects .
both of projects are in , and in ethiopia and one in tunisia .
they also have common that the different from different perspectives are a part of the brain of architecture .
the first example started with a invitation , a the - in a in - capital in capital .
this is the kind of building that we us , my team and me , as an example of what we should be shown .
first of all , i thought i wanted to .
after we saw some of these buildings -- there 's lots of in the city -- we that they have three of features .
first , these are these buildings , they very large very large , people do n't afford to buy things .
second , they need a lot of energy because the surfaces are glass , the heat inside , and then you need lots of lots .
in a city where not should happen , because they have pretty the weather that 's been 25 to 20 25 .
and thirdly , their nothing and with to do with ethiopia and ethiopia .
this is a place in a place called a rich culture and tradition .
and also , i was really first to the first really of the old the with the old market with this the - , where thousands of people go and to , day , day .
it has also this idea of space that uses the the of to create activity .
so i thought , this is exactly what i really want to design , not a .
but the question was , how we could build a building , building with these principles .
the next challenge came to when we were to this , because it 's in a city town of the city , where most of the buildings you were sitting on the picture , there were n't there .
it 's between two between that have across a hundreds of meters .
first , we created a connection between these two streets , and then there all the the of the building .
this is a - the , that creates a in the building that is itself through its own shape and sun and rain .
so , we this , we the idea of the with a little with a little that in every , because of the shape of the change .
i also think , how do we end up the building ?
i really wanted to find a solution to the local .
i started thinking about think like a out of concrete in the that which the air , and the light , but in the form .
and then i this these beautiful buttons in the the .
they have the properties of a geometry , and that helped me to the entire .
we 're building this with little , the windows that air and light on the into the buildings .
and this is going through these little , little bits , which the light from the to building the building at the building .
it was n't just the to with ideas with these ideas , because they thought , " this is not a not - . that did n't have . "
but then we realized that this idea of the is a much more than the idea of a , because they can do more .
the concept of the was a much , much more . not just because of the material compared of glass , but also because we had no longer conditioning .
so we created some the - that we used to project .
the first time was to think about how we could make the building buildings , in a city that has almost every day .
we created a call the , by on the roof on the roof .
and under this these , we this as a new public space with space and that we could make this .
these the on the roof , the water to the into the .
hopefully , at the beginning of the next year , because we have the to five 5 .
the second example is a the - in 2000 in the and in .
so to do a big project , the biggest project i 've ever been , i had to understand the city of the city , but also the environment , the tradition , the tradition and the culture .
and as this analysis , i , i 'm particularly on the , the old - old structure that was from by a wall , 12 , and by nearly was connected to the .
when i first came to the first , first started to build existing to create the first 12 of , with large size and like in and other cities in cities .
so , we some of the points in the at the of these and they with straight lines , and the changed the original pattern .
the final step was to think about the cell , the small cell of the project , as the as , as a part of the .
what would the best in a climate for a apartment ?
this is the , because of the the between the between the between the two the that created and a natural .
so we a pattern about the that the most that most of the most are perfectly in this direction .
and this is the result , it 's almost like a combination of a european and the arab city .
there are the blocks with the and there are all these kinds of things .
it also local that , which is higher density to the upper and a lower density in a whole .
it also the concept of the .
the volume has this shape form that has evolved through three different of , and also to very dense light into the ground , there are three different of , like a and a kindergarten and a nearby of a of the that
the roof , my - in this project , gives the community 's almost the space , which is going to build the building .
there can all neighbors and things and make things like a the - like the morning , from a building to another building .
these two examples have a common approach to the brain .
they 're in emerging , where you can see the cities literally .
in cities , the changes of architecture in the today and future life will create the local communities and the as buildings .
and that reason , i think it 's important to architecture , but solutions , the solutions that the relationship the relationship between the community and the environment and the to nature and connecting .
thank you very much .
i want to talk about trust , and i want to talk to you about the magic opinions .
they 're so ubiquitous to they used to become the .
and that 's what i think about three .
first of all : trust is a in the , many .
then we goal , we should trust .
and a task : we should to rebuild the confidence .
i think the claim the goal and the challenge to the wrong ideas .
i want to give you a different story about a claim , a goal and a that is a lot better approach to the .
first of the claim : why do people say that ?
and if i really talk to my talk , i know , i do n't know the answer .
maybe it in some , or some , or some , in some of .
i 'm not going to .
but i course , i can look at the extreme that the are the source of faith that it 's a .
look at a look at a period of a , is not a lot of to .
and will be people who are 20 years ago , mainly journalists and politicians , still .
and the people who was very about 20 years ago , still very , very , : the , nurses .
we 're other between , and by the way , the average citizens almost in the middle .
but is that a good proof ?
the - -- .
what could you be that ?
so you look at the general mindset of people when you 're asking certain questions .
trust politicians ? trust ?
now , if you asked somebody asked , do you trust ?
trust it 's ?
trust it 's ?
and then would you would say , " ? "
and that would be a reasonable response .
and if you answer the answer to you , you might say , " i 'm not some of you , but not . "
it 's rational .
in short , we 're in our short lives , we 're in different ways .
we do n't think of it that we every of a or in a or in a .
so i could say that i had a particular given , i 'm a , first grade , the first class , i would n't want to make you .
maybe i know that i know that she does n't have well .
i that my friend a conversation on running , but perhaps not that she was a secret .
simple .
so know how we know from our everyday ways , how different can look , why do we know this knowledge when we think about trust ?
the situation are doing a very bad thing about the actual , because they ignore the sense of the that you 're in the .
second , we get to .
the goal is to trust more .
honestly , i think that 's the stupid .
i would n't going to be .
i would try to trust the more of the , but not n't .
i 'm not allowed to do it to trust .
and those who have to raise their savings to the hands of a certain event , which the way , the , " the the " i , " i think , too much .
" trust is not a real goal in this life .
trust and be and be to be the goal .
and then you say , yeah , okay , what is the most important is not trust , but it .
the people can people from .
and to do that , we need to look at three things .
are you ? are you honest ? are you ?
if we can a person in the of , and , and we can find , we have a good reason to trust , trust , they 're .
but the person is n't , but it 's probably not .
some of my friends are and i , i would n't make them letter , because they are the .
i have friends who are very in their own , but they 're , but they 're .
and i 'm very happy about that i do n't have many friends that are the and , but are .
if you have , i did n't even have it .
but after that , we 're looking at , then .
trust is the response .
the we have to do that , of course , that 's hard .
over the past decades , we 've tried to design , in all sorts of treatments and experts and experts and that will make us to make it more .
many of these systems have the effect .
they do n't work like .
a the said once said to me , " the problem is that the would longer be free than the baby to the world . "
everywhere in our public lives , in our institutions , our institutions , our this problem , and this is to and , but it leads to the opposite .
it 's people like people 's people their tasks , by taking them to .
i can , can any of .
so , 's the goal .
the goal is more , and that 's difficult to be if we want to be , and want to want to communicate and other , and if we want to whether people are , or politicians ,
it 's not easy . you have to do it . simple reactions or not n't do n't .
and now to the task .
and as this as a as of the , the .
because it suggests that you should trust and trust .
we can do that for ourselves .
we can go a little bit .
so , people can improve people to improve their .
but ultimately , it 's a lot of that it 's being done by other .
you ca n't build the what other one .
you have to give you a serious that you trust .
so you have to be .
and of course , of course , is that you do n't usually all of the people at the nose .
but they need to have to have that they are .
how does that ?
this happens happening every day , everywhere . people do doing , very effective .
here 's a simple example .
the store i my , i put them up and they ask no questions .
they take them back and give me back to me , or a few of the in the .
that 's great . i 'll you , because you 've been shown to me .
there 's a morality of morality .
you think of the as vulnerable , it 's a very good sense that you 're being , and you 're to your own .
so our goal is not very difficult to recognize .
it 's relationships between people , and the the , when and if the other is .
so the morality of history is much less much about trust or about faith , the of the or the , and much more about , and how you people , and evidence of the own .
thank you .
you know , the best thing i 'm most for me is the films i can look .
i love my own my with my kids , and when my daughter was four years old , we 've together , " the " of " . "
the film has n't left it .
her , of course , was the .
so she had a good excuse to wear a the dress , and a the .
but if you look at this film , often look , you see how it is .
we live in the today and our children in a kind of a - a - a - .
but " the was by " .
he did n't have this trend .
it took 40 years to this trend , with -- a different movie , a guy from a , and a guy with a lot of a girl , and they the the as the as the the of the .
you know what i 'm talking about , right ?
right .
well , there 's a big difference between these two films , even several differences between the of and all the movies that we are today .
first of all , there are in " the of " very violence .
the monkeys are pretty aggressive , as the the .
but i think if the had of the by the , today , who would have said , " the , " the , you are the the of that we 've been once .
use your own shoes to order to read computers by the end of evil of the . "
but it 's not happening .
another point i 'm the most " the by the " is very unique , is that the and are more characters .
this is what i first time when i was my daughter , star , " and i was , years later , and was different .
at that point , i had a son .
he was at the time three years old .
he was n't invited to this . he was too young .
but he was the second child , and he was less than his sister .
so he 's a , and he 's the film , he 's a his mother 's mother , and i do n't think he 's understood what he was going on , but he it 's in .
and i wondered what he was doing .
did he think that it 's courage , courage and ?
he the that a army a army to get the government ?
he 's that there 's only boys in the , and of course , who is that really cool , but during the time , so that the heroes with a and a the to the , the he was
compare this with " the of " .
how does your the your to a good end ?
by with all the and a .
this is the kind of world i my children my -- , right ? and not in the world , which are struggling with , which is so much of our world today .
why is there so much -- in the movies that are children for our children , and so few so the ?
there 's a lot of good literature about the impact that on the boys , on the , and you should read them . it 's very good .
but i did n't read that much about how guys with this .
i know from a experience that the could n't the model that i could have to find the world of adults , and girls in girls and common .
i think there was this moment with the first kiss , when i really expect that the the starts , so that ends a movie , right ?
i 've my mission , i the girl .
why are you there ?
i do n't know what to do .
the movies are very to the and their heart , and there 's not a lot of space for other relationships and other .
it does almost like as a young animal , and if you 're a girl , you should better get better the .
there are exceptions , and i 'm going to be the the of any of you .
but they give you a message to the young kids that boys are not the .
they 're real to teach the girls how to the to , but they show the boys not necessarily how they should to the .
there 's no way for them .
there are also some women who are writing to write new stories for our kids and also are , are still more .
and the most common of all the time , is a classic after the other , and every single one of you , a boy , or a man , or two of men who are friends , or a son and his son , two men who
until as many of you think of -- this year when they got the movie " -- the " the the . "
i recommend him all of you . he 's on the internet .
do you remember what the critic said , " the " ?
" oh , i ca n't believe that has made a . "
it 's very good . do n't get it that .
but as well , none of these movies has the .
i do n't know if you 've heard of it .
it has n't have n't really , and meaning , but maybe we 're going to start today .
the is a the and in the middle of the this , that she with a friend of the films that had seen .
it 's very simple . there are just three questions you need to : there 's more than one character in the film , which is , and something ?
try to get that .
and talk about women in the time of the ?
and what 's in their entertainment is something else , than the guy they like ?
how ? thank you .
thank you very much .
two women who exist and talk talking about anything .
this is what happens . i saw it , and yet i see it pretty rare in the movies that we know and love .
in fact , i went to the , to see a very good movie , " the . "
you remember ? a lot of a in the the , great the , a general sense of what a good - is .
it falls with the the .
i think that should n't do it because of the time -- i do n't know if you 've seen it , but a lot of the 's playing in a message where men and women during the .
there are some good scenes that men in this deep , of fear , and the great moment , one of the the , is to go through a door and say , " you go to bed , " ? "
this is some of hollywood .
so let 's look at look at the numbers .
in 2011 , under the 100 of movies , what do you think how many of these were actually female ?
11 . it 's not a .
it 's not as many of as the number of women who just congress , so that 's good .
but there 's a number that bigger than this is and this is will be this space .
last year , the new york times published a published that has government .
you that you 're saying that you .
one of five women in the united states that they 've been to be in their life .
i do n't think that 's the fault of general .
i do n't think that the have to do anything .
i do n't even think that and directly to do with something , but something 's going on , and when i hear this statistics , one of the things i think is that many are .
who are these guys ? what are they doing ?
what do you learn to learn ?
take your story , that it 's the task of a male , the violence with violence and then the , which is a woman who does n't have friends and not talking about it ?
so let 's take this story ?
you know , as a parent that has privilege , a daughter , just like the same of the same thing , we find this world and these statistics very and we want to .
we have a like " the , and we hope that help , but i 'm also wonder whether it 's going to be , when we 're at the same time , active or , our , our , "
the the is a means that we can do something very important , and i 'm talking to the .
i think we need to do our new just a new definition of
the definition of the is already changing .
they 've read how the new york of the roles of the and .
they 're going to the .
our sons will find a way to adapt to new relationship , and i think we really have to show you that a is man is his sisters and on their side , and really the bad guys who are men who want to
i think we should be looking for the the to find the , if we find them , and find the search that are there are real human beings to bring people together and to with these and say , " i 'm on
when i was my daughter , who her the in " star wars , " you know what you said ?
the .
the and the .
what have these two common ?
maybe it 's not just the most dress .
i think these two figures are experts .
these are the characters in the who know more than others and their knowledge to with other people to help them help their potential of their potential .
and also , they leaders .
i like this kind of job for my daughter , and i like this kind of job for my son .
i want to do more tasks like this .
i want to tasks that my son said , " and go and " and tasks , to join a team , maybe a team that will be to a to help better people better , better people , the of
thank you very much .
i want to talk to you about the story of a the .
i do n't know his name , but it 's his story .
he lives in a small village in south .
his village is near .
the drought of the poverty and the and the the .
and when there was nothing there was him , he left his village , and he walked into the city , in this case , the , the capital .
as he , there is no opportunities , no jobs , no way .
at the end , he 's in a outside of the .
it may not a year , but nothing .
one day , he will take a man from a man who him to lunch , to dinner , to the breakfast ,
he 's this group of young people , and they give him a chance .
he gets a little money to buy new clothes to feed money and home to home .
this is him to young this young woman .
he finally . he .
he starts a new life .
his life has a sense .
on a beautiful day in the , the , a walk into the air .
this the of the was the and the and dynamic group of young people were the to have a the with .
how could the story of a of that just trying to in the end that he himself in the air ?
he had waited .
he had an opportunity to focus on the future , and a it , the was the first opportunity to him .
it was the first thing to him from a state that we call " the . "
and his story is always over again over the areas of around the world .
it 's the story of the , urban - youth , who are in and london and something different than . "
young people are from the city , from their jobs , jobs , wealth , but , but young people do n't have to share the wealth of their cities .
often it 's the youth that are under the high - .
in 2030 , three are five of five to five cities in 18 .
if we do n't young people in the growth of cities , if we do n't give them opportunities , they will be " , the in the , in violence and violence cities .
in my the , the , suffering , 70 percent of young people are under unemployment .
70 percent do n't have work , do n't go to school .
they do n't actually do anything .
last month , i went back to after the , and i went to the the , where hospital where i was born .
i remember , i was this hospital , and i asked , what if i would never be here ?
what if i had to the same condition of " forced ?
would i have become ?
i 'm not sure what i 'm going to do .
the reason for this was actually a of a of young and leaders .
i was about 90 young leaders .
we sat together and we started a solutions for the largest challenges of their city .
in the room , a young man , the .
he went to university in and his .
there was no jobs and no options .
i remember he said that he had a the , was frustrated , frustrated was the perfect goal , be member , and other .
they 're people like him .
but this story takes another different .
in , the biggest obstacles are to from a to b , the streets .
23 years , the completely destroyed , so that the best thing is best .
and the the opportunity and they .
he 's a .
he began to stop on the , could n't afford to afford .
and with his family and friends , he bought his 10 , and he , and he was going to be able to get his in the next three years .
how do this story from the other ?
what makes the difference ?
i think it 's his ability to a new opportunity .
it 's the the , and i think that the can be the means to be the means "
it 's the young people to do the economic opportunity that which they 're desperately .
you can teach young people to be entrepreneurs .
i want to talk to you about a young guy who one of my , : the , a the .
he helped me to bring the most of some of the young people who are at the summit , and to them how to build and .
he 's actually the first the that has been since 22 years , until before was there , the the was that was the by the ship from the abroad , when you wanted to the wedding of the wedding .
if you asked someone , " when did you last time you ever seen this last time ? " then the answer of many of the during the , " never . "
so saw an opportunity .
he started a the with a .
he was a outside of the , and started to the and the and , to what he could survive in the climate .
he started to take to with flowers , and he was in and , and to around the city , and he was working on the first of the public in the last years .
there 's no public parks in the .
he wants to create a place where families and young people are together , and he says , he can teach the beautiful things about life .
just 's the , it does n't because it 's because too much water .
so the first step is to bring people , and in that room , had a very large impact on the other young people in the room .
they had never really thought about it a .
they thought to work for a work or for government , but this story , his innovation , had a strong impact on it .
he the them to look at their city as a place of view .
he them to be that they can be entrepreneurs , they could change the change .
so the end of the day , they were innovative solutions for some of the greatest challenges of their city .
they had the local solutions to local .
the inspiration of young people , and the of a is a big , but young people need to their ideas .
they need the and to develop her business and develop business .
they 're people with the resources that they need , they give them the support they need to ideas and they will going to create the for growth .
for me , me , more than just a of a .
it 's about social .
the - selling sell not just flowers .
i think he hope .
his design is " the , " when it created , the view of people to their city .
the has the who to help him to stop the and the .
he gave them the chance to the state of state of "
these young businesses have a tremendous impact on their cities .
so my suggestion is , you to young people to get people , and their own innovations and you 'll talk about stories about flowers and " instead of " and "
thank you very much .
so during my childhood , my was one of my favorite the to the on the on the of , because my parents are , happiness .
but these are hard to find .
they 're from sand , barely .
but after a certain period , i had a .
i started seeing , and patterns that helped me , they collect .
and it was to find a passion to find things that i love for , and the .
and when i started studying , i realized that see that my eyes n't eyes with my eyes .
because suddenly , in egypt , my beach in a car of a miles , along the the , and my the grew up to the size of cities .
and that led me to use the .
i had to see differently to see the past in a map .
so i want to show you how we example to we differently , if we use .
this is a site that 's in the eastern called the .
and the appears - brown , we use but we 're , but it 's with color , that 's will be the .
what you see here is the chemical changes of the landscape of landscape through the and the of the old egyptians .
what i want to share with you today is how we used to find a city that which the name , and for thousands of years .
the was the capital of the old egypt , egypt for more than years , a called the , about years ago .
the is the in the world , and it 's very efficient because it 's in the middle realm of the arts of art , architecture and religion .
and , knew always that the of the somewhere near the , the two , the red , but in the massive , but in this massive .
this area is huge -- it 's the four times three times three .
once the , the , the , directly to the the , and , as it moves , and , and towards the west , it 's the city .
so how do you find a city in a .
they 're to find to be the equivalent to find the needle in the , with eyes and eyes .
so we used to the - to - map a map of the landscape to see to see a , changes ,
where the of the of the used to be used .
but you see , and that 's very interesting , this very bright , with the circle that we can as a possible position for the city .
so we worked with the scientists , to the what you see here .
this is like the ice , except instead of layers , change , climate change , you can , human .
in a depth of five meters , under a layer of , we found a density layer of the .
so this shows that this position for the , in five meters , in five meters , we can find more over several hundred years of the , to the realm of the , to the the , which we the existence of existence
we also found the -- the -- the , the and the -- which shows that a has a .
it might not look at much , but if you look at the the stones , which were used by the in the rich , you find these rocks .
so we found a density layer of the the of at this that 's on the rich .
we also found evidence for a for the society , which shows that this is a very important city .
but there 's not a the , but we 're going to get back to this site , we 'll going to draw a map .
what is important , we have about young who are trained in the school , so they are able to make great discoveries .
so i wanted to be my with my the from the middle of the , it was in the city of the years ago .
" knowledge sharing is the biggest of all the .
there 's nothing in this in the . "
ted was n't necessarily 1984 .
ideas , but actually , 1984 about a long , long , city , from the .
you can see , you can compare the in the .
thank you very much .
thank you .
i grew up in taiwan as a daughter of a the , to my beautiful memories , my me to the beauty , the and the form of the chinese .
i was , i was fascinated by this incredible language .
but for a , it seems to as the as the great wall of china .
i 've been wondering how i 've been able to do this wall , so everyone anyone to understand the interest of this complex , this , and understand and .
i thought that was a new way of learning , to be useful .
since five , i learned every single every single every single every single in every single in every single in the .
i 've spent every day in the next 15 years .
we just have five minutes , we have a and very difficult to be very useful .
a chinese the has about 20,000 .
you only need 1,000 thousand for a simple the .
the most important 200 you are to 40 percent of the simple to understand -- enough to enough , to understand the and the of the .
so today i start with eight to show you how the method works .
are you ready ?
open your mouth as possible until it 's .
it 's going to " a mouth . "
that person goes to a person .
" human . "
when the the for fire , a " with a person , if he was saying , " help ! i ! -- and the 's is going to the of the , but i like this idea . you take the you
this is a tree .
" tree . "
this is a mountain .
the sun is . "
the moon . "
the the for " looks like a wild from the .
these eight are .
they are the the to create a variety of .
a human .
if someone else is , it means " follow . "
it 's more , then , two " and " and " a " .
if a human his poor , " says , " it was this big . "
the person in the mouth , it 's like .
he 's a " , " as a in the whale .
a tree is a tree , two trees are a " . "
three are together for a " forest . "
and you put a under tree , and you have a "
put a on top of it , it means " the . "
just to remember because is a tree is a pretty the .
remember , fire ?
two the on the hot . "
three fire together are a lot of " . "
they put the fire under two trees , it 's " . "
for us , the sun is the source of the .
two together . "
three together are together .
when the sun and the moon , it means " it 's " . "
in the context , it 's be for the next day .
the sun goes across the horizon .
door . a in the door stands to the " the . "
so , put a mouth into the door , it , " ask questions . "
the , the . is there ?
this person the from the door . " , " . "
the left is the woman . "
two women are two for a " . "
and in three women , this is called " the . "
we have now 30 of .
and with this method , you can put the in the first eight words .
the next group of eight are up with other words .
so with a little bit of a few hundred , you can learn a hundred of a child - old child .
if we can make these , we start them .
for example , it makes mountain and fire , and so it 's a "
we know , japan is the land of the sun .
this is the sun with the " because japan is a of china .
a sun with the is called " the . "
