when i was in my 20s , i had my first the .
i was a and i was particularly in berkeley . berkeley .
she was a woman named alex .
when the came up the first meeting , she was wearing and a - and she fell on the in my office , her , and she told me to talk about .
and when i heard that , i was a .
my , had a patient as a first patient .
and i got a woman in the people who wanted to talk about .
i 'll get the i .
but i did n't get it .
with the stories that alex did with the back , it was easy to me just to head with head , while we 're faced the problems .
" 30 is the new 20 " , " alex and i did , i had the right . she was right .
work was later , later came later , later came later , later came later .
people in the in the , and alex , i had nothing time .
but soon , my was , the , .
i was .
i said , " yeah , you know , you 're with your with your , you with a , but she 's not going to marry . "
and then said , " well , " but , but maybe you 'll going to next the next .
and also the best thing to work on the marriage before they before married . "
this is what psychologists call a the .
that was the moment that i realized that 30 was not the new 20 .
well , people later on the , as a , but did n't do the of the .
and this was a of the , and the , and we sat and we sat them .
and i realized that this kind of the was a problem with real consequences , only for and their the , but for the , families and all people in the .
at this point , in the united states 50 million people in the .
we talk about 15 percent of the population , or 100 percent if you say that nobody can get the without going to go through the .
so you , when you 're in your .
i want to show you some of you .
oh , yeah ! you 're all incredible .
if you work with somebody , the , loves , because of a you in a , i 'm going to see you -- people .
my are in people in the , because i think that every should have 50 million of what psychologists , and wisdom , the of the most important and most things that you can do for work for , for
this is not my opinion . that 's facts . facts .
we know that 80 percent of the percent of the moments are to 35 .
that means that 10 of 10 decisions , experiences and experiences who are living with life , which is what you 're , until you 're 30 ,
do n't you want to talk about 40 .
this group is going to get well , i think .
we know that the first 10 years of a of a is a on how much money .
we know that 30 than 30 than half of americans are married or with the future partner or a partner .
we know that brain is going to be the and big grow in the and the and the for the , which means whatever you want to you , you now time to time to do that .
we know that the during the of the , in the of the , in the life and the women the women the with the their peak , and they 're 35 to 35 .
so in the , you should be the over the body and the own possibilities .
if we think about the development of a child , we know that the first five years for years and are in the brain .
it 's the time that the ordinary , life has a impact on the future .
but we hear about little bit about there are something like , and our are a time for a .
but the people get people in the .
the press talking about the the of the the .
scientists call the a - .
journalists , the the of people in the people in like the " or " or " the . "
that 's true .
so as culture , we have the what the decade is the .
the that things with a plan and a little bit time .
is n't that ?
so what happens if you put someone in the ' head , head , say , " you , you 've got 10 years to make a little of life ?
nothing .
this person is the the and the and the the . and it does n't happen .
and so every day , people in the people like their or your sons and daughters into my office and say something like , " i know , my friend does n't good , but not n't tell that story . i 'm just the time
or you say , " all , i 've been able to 30 years 30 years ago , it 's all good . "
but later , it sounds like , " my are almost and i did n't have any the .
i had a better , when i had finished college . "
and then it sounds like , " in my , was like the .
all the and had fun , but then , 30 , the music was out of and everybody started to .
i did n't want to be the only ones that i stayed . i sometimes i my husband , because he was in my chair .
where are the people in the in here ?
does n't do that .
ok , that 's easy to say , but does n't make mistakes , because it 's about much .
if you have been to the , there 's a enormous pressure in the back to the a quickly , a city , a city , a partner and two or three children or two children in a lot of time .
many of these things are more and like , and just show it just and the and the , all the time in the .
the does n't mean to buy a red .
it means that you can do the career you want to do .
you ca n't have this kid you can n't want to be able to or ca n't give you a child .
too many people in the and , and myself and myself and me and say , " what , " what i did ? what i ? "
i want to change what people in the do .
this is a story that shows how it can .
it 's the story of .
and was my in when she was 25 , she had a the .
she said she 'd like to work in the art or in the , but she had n't decided , she had been in the last few years .
because the was , with her friend , who more his .
and although their were their years were been worse .
they often in the , but then she would up and said , " your family could you , you , your friends . "
one day , came very and almost all the hour .
she had bought a bought , and she spent the morning her , and then she came up the that came to the , " in the , in the , "
she was almost the when she came up and said , " who 's going to be me if i have a accident ?
who will be me when i have cancer ? "
at the moment i had to say , say , " i . "
but the real no music did really care about .
a needed a better life , and i knew this was their opportunity .
i had my first patient to a , to , just like the in the .
in the next weeks and months , i was three - to - anyone who anyone , whether or man or woman ,
one , i told her , she had n't have any the , she was a of a .
so i would i to you , you something that would be to .
power to do for you is a investment , invest in something you might be next .
i knew about a chinese , and no one knows how the future looks like , but i know : the .
so now , time is this job international job , this , this the , which is try to try .
i 'm not the of the but not that the who did n't even have any .
this is the .
i said to the , the , but what .
second , i said , the urban - is .
good friends are to get to the airport , but , the people with people who are thinking about how they 're , they what they , how they 're doing and where they 're .
this new this new person , the , the most of the outside of outside of the own .
new things are made of " the , " so friends
it 's true : the half of the is not , or not at all .
but the other half it 's not and they the .
half of jobs never . if you 're the boss to your neighbors , your the , not a job .
this is not a little bit of information .
the last advice : what believed that you could n't choose the family , but the friends .
this was for her as she was , but as soon as soon as soon she would soon her own family , if you had a partner and family a family .
i said her , a new family , now .
you might think that it 's better than 20 than 20 or 20 , and i 'll agree to you .
but the , you to or in your life , if everybody 's facebook , is not an progress .
the best time to your marriage , before you have a , and that means that the means of the in love in love in love to
your family , means , and the and what you do , and not , because it works , or anybody with the time that you 're just .
so what happened to do ?
we went through her and she found the brilliant of a the who in a different state in a museum .
this weak band is to her work , get a work .
this was a the that gave her friend her friend her to her .
now , five years later , it 's the for museums .
she got a man who she invented .
she loves her new and new family and she told me a map , said , " now the line is " in the , you do n't get enough . "
the sounds like sounds like this is everything easy , but that 's what i love in love .
it 's so easy to help them .
in the way , like the planes , the just left out the and to the west .
and right after the , a little bit of the difference make a difference whether you can in or in .
this is true of the , the , or the , a good conversation , a beautiful , a very beautiful can have a tremendous impact over years , even over generations .
this is an idea that all of the that knows .
it 's just as easy to i said to .
i have the privilege to this day , everyday : the are not the new , so you 're on a , a , you can use your own experience .
do n't tell you what you did n't , not .
your now .
thank you very much .
in the entire , it was always our goal to take the distance between and information , which is between the world and our world on the screen where we can our imagination .
and this distance is smaller , smaller and smaller , and now it 's smaller than a millimeter that 's a , and computers are for every .
but i wondered what it would be if there was no limit at all .
i looked like what would look like .
first i 've this tool in which digital world is , so if you focus on the screen , it to the physical character .
designers can put their ideas directly into 3d and surgeons , to the at the same screen .
so this was built by the tool that the was so the .
but our hands still remain outside the .
how can we do the , with the digital information and the whole the of our hands ?
at microsoft , i 've with my mentor , the , computer , and a little room on the keyboard in a keyboard of a keyboard .
so that a computer screen and screen and the of the of and fingers and fingers face , you can put his hands from the keyboard , put the and the with the hands .
and windows and put a position in the position room , you can easily it as you can a book from a shelf .
then you can through this book and , and all this , the of the the .
architects can their hands and .
so in these two examples , we 're into digital world .
but what if we could take that all the time and the digital information ?
i 've sure many of you have already experience to articles online later .
but now you have n't worry about it anymore .
here i have a " the . "
and this is the view of you , you a - head - or - old - , - old - , - shaped - the - geometry system .
this idea of idea , i started thinking about it that the n't just look in the space in the room , but it in , so we could make them and feel .
what would a like this ?
in mit media lab , i with my the and my collaborators , i , a .
now , in this case , this is like a tiny - in our world , that means that computers , and people can see this object everywhere -- at least this little the of this .
effectively , we have the gravity and control the motion by creating cheap , and these .
by the digital program , we it from the constraints and space and time , and we can move human movements now , and in the real world .
so example can about the , or , or the , or the , and , and again in the real world .
so , can use this to use complex concepts and physics and , unlike a the or a , or a , and a is a real and experience that experience and it 's very powerful .
and more than just what we 're right now , we have , in , it 's to imagine how the of the world is going to change our daily activity .
as you can , digital will not only us to just us , but to interact with us as part of our physical environment , we ourselves from our world .
today we have begun by talking about borders , but when we limit the limit , the only frontier our imagination .
thank you very much .
i was been to for two years to become a the , in china , china , in the 1970s .
i was in the first grade , i wanted to get government for school , all paid .
but my mother said , " no . "
my parents wanted me to become a .
after they the , they believed , that the only way to happiness is to do and safer good job .
it 's not important if i do n't job or job .
but my dream was to become a chinese - being .
i 'm that i on my piano .
a - to has to start with the start , so i tried to try to go to the .
i wrote even at the and the and the of a the .
but the adult does n't idea my idea .
the adults did n't believe it was me about it .
only my friends had me , but they were also only as children as i as i .
and i was 15 , i was to with the training .
so my dream would never be true .
i was afraid of that i could only take my rest of my life , only a second .
but that 's so that .
so i had to look at my head , i could find another other .
no one there to me something about it ? well .
so i to .
i the my hunger to the , i had a book on the book , and i was the my of my a , while the the tradition , " which i learned about this , " in the " , "
[ " the " ] [ " ] " history of the ] the came in the united states , and what did i read about ?
of course , books that are in china .
" the good earth " is the entire life of chinese .
it 's simply not as propaganda . i understood .
the bible is interesting , but weird .
but that 's a subject for another time .
but the fifth one taught me a way : " you know your father and your mother . "
" i thought , " i thought , " that 's so much better than much better than " . "
that was my way to get me to the and to the relationship to my relationship to my parents .
through with a new culture , i started reading the the .
this was a whole of .
for example , i did n't really take this very interesting first because chinese students with this .
it never occurred to me that the china is not going to be in the center of the world .
so a map tells something about personal .
the reading is actually nothing new .
in the academic world , it 's a the .
there are actually the like the and the .
comparison and a of a of a .
so i thought if you read reading in the research , why does n't work in everyday daily ?
so i began to read two books at the same time .
you can of people -- [ " benjamin franklin by the , " john " by david , who was the same , or friends with friends with common with .
[ " we " from " the " -- " life is a the of the -- and i 've stories different cultures , like joseph the book , " joseph " ] and for example , had to three .
in were , the were the the of the , and political nature .
and they were all nature : they , and social -- interesting .
if you make a physical , it also fun to read the the in languages .
[ " the for " for a thomas called " the of the water -- the the of " the " rather than me in translation , i found out how much i can win .
i 'm to , i of , " happiness , " happiness " happiness " happiness " joy . "
" in " means " new " new . "
books are like an incredible , you have a connection to the people and the present .
i know that i never feel more or i 'm feel .
a dream is really nothing to comparison what many other have .
i came to the belief that it 's not the only purpose of a single purpose .
his purpose is to get us to in , where dreams , where our passion and our happiness .
even a dream can this purpose .
because of i am i 'm here today , happy , happy , with a with a , in a , with a lot of time .
you 're always be with .
thank you very much .
thank you very much .
thank you very much .
when i was eight years old , a new girl in the class , and she was so , as girls as girls .
she had a long hair and a little the , was in and .
in the , i , until i until i had a the plan .
so i stayed one day a little longer in school , a longer , and i was in the the .
when the air was out , i went into , i went into the classroom and i took the the of the the .
and then i did .
i the the notes of my the , just some few of .
all of the .
when i wanted to make this book , i noticed that some of my other had been played pretty good grades .
so i the in the every day , all of .
i gave all of all of and i myself i was because i was because i was also all the time .
i 'm still more about my behavior .
i do n't understand where the came .
i do n't understand why i was so good at this .
i felt really good .
i do n't even know why i never been for .
it was so obvious .
i was never caught .
but most of me , most of me , why is it so that this little girl was so good in
i 'm not happy .
she 's so , so .
we know babies are under suffering .
similarly as primates . the are from nature from very .
we know that the of the is in among in the united states .
but i never a study that their or their .
so , we need to the literature , the because the novel is the lab that the in the in their forms .
is it a to say that if we do n't have a , we did n't have any literature ?
so no the , no , .
no the king , no " out of the . "
no shakespeare .
because , the of the the of because we lose , " and " , " the , " the . "
no , no , no , i know that it 's in , say that the has everything has , but in the , he really .
this year , we this , the 's the , " for the long time , " and his analysis of the sexual - and the of the , my , that my thing we hope .
think , think about feelings . right ?
we think of the little boy that try to sleep .
we think of a piece of cake , in the .
we forget how the vision was vision .
we forget how the it is .
these are books are the kind of the as the as the .
i do n't know how the is , but let 's say , it 's a .
let 's look at why the novel and the and the and the and so well .
is it so obvious that , -- , such a basis for a story ?
i do n't know . i think it 's just hard to the , because think , what happens when we 're .
when we 're a , we tell a story .
tell us stories about people 's lives and they make it bad , because they 're so that it 's bad .
as a , of the history and the audience we know what the detail has to the into the , right ?
and we all to us , and so that 's the .
in the first band , " in world , the , one of the great , thinks about his care and , in the course of the , they 're as long , and he will go , " wait ! " i 'm going to
everything you give me and joy , might be somebody else , joy , even in this moment . "
this is the story that he told , and from there to the to the that every the of every new he knows he discovered in his , his in his the .
we 've got to admit that the and the are the .
and friends have to leave the country if they want to with it .
but you do n't need to be to realize that it hard work . right ?
the is .
it 's a the feeling that 's to be .
what does the ?
i want to get .
i want to .
it 's like the hair and little .
i want like photos .
so , 's why it 's why you have to be successful .
basically , the language of science and science and the .
when the these , suddenly out of the door , and the the of his , he this behavior .
he says , " you think you 'll be the , but it 's not a to find a text , or a . "
he says , " there 's scientific worth . "
and what 's trying to show is that the is and makes us look at , but in their core , you 're looking for a truth , truth , truth , and the truth , the more , the better .
so , that 's for the way to wisdom .
he says , " a woman we need to suffer us , us , us a bigger and more than the genius of a man who 's interested . "
he tells us about that we should make women ?
no . i think he 's us to say that he tells us something about us .
is there another different that we us in this particular way ?
and we realized that we feel our and our and more ?
we can see different with such with these kinds of sound ?
freud should be write about this .
one day was a by a very young man who was who was by the thought of his wife that his wife was .
and freud says , this man is kind of odd , because he does n't even know what his wife does .
because she 's innocent , and everybody knows that .
the poor creature is lower under .
instead , he looking for his , without it , the .
she too , she to with a man ?
[ freud ] says that the man is the of the of his wife .
the novel is very good at this point .
the novel describes very well , how much hard - us , but not the .
because the more we are , the more we it to us .
so i think that way that we do n't get us to do a or .
i 'm to be very .
and i think about myself about eight years , but i also think about the story i heard in the news .
a woman from michigan was written , because she was designed by a himself of a the year , the news himself .
a year .
she tried to get her new friend of her shoes into the shoes , and i to when i heard , i was with .
because ... let 's be honest .
what does it mean , creativity , creativity , right ?
this is something from a novel .
this is something from a novel the .
the is one of my favorite .
she 's the most the and the woman who 's the american .
from her , " two " in the " and the the mr. the , " it books how to -- to keep our spirit , and we 're once in the rich of the that 's in the in between the what 's could be --
take tom the , your character .
first , all , tom , you have , and you have , and she has what they had once , and they 're like by the , and he 's on their name , he name their jewelry , he 's her .
this is a method .
but what do we do ? we ca n't make it as tom .
i ca n't give the world , even though i 'd like it to some days .
it 's a shame , because we live in a period .
we live in a " - era . time .
we are all good social media that are in the , right ?
what 's the novel of the ? i 'm not sure .
but we do what do if they do n't if they 're in a of a .
let 's go back to the street and ask questions to the .
think of the , think of his the as professor , this great .
but i always [ ] , the boss of the with the face of a rat , the the needs , needs to be the , but it .
this is me familiar .
so , needs his help , and it and the stories of stories of stories .
but when she started to start to something , and eventually in the six - as " the , and all of his solution , the the , to the and says , " we 're not the on them , mr. the .
we 're proud . them . "
and he 's that there 's no to - the - , - the - hand - , - hand - hand ,
this is one of the few times that we the back in his stories , and i think this little very smart , but also ,
it seems like not as an emotional , but a problem .
in a moment , a is a on a different like .
and the next moment on you 're on a wavelength .
suddenly , it 's to this , he has to him .
is it really easy ?
what if really only a problem , if it was only about how we deal with the other relationship ?
maybe we would n't be to be a .
we could make us .
but i like the .
while we 're waiting for , we still the literature as a .
literature alone , the .
literature alone , they can , they .
and who 's all the : the good news , the the tom , the crazy the , the , the .
we are in society .
thank you very much .
i was about 10 years old , and on a the - old with my father in the father , a the - in the northern of the new york .
it was a great day .
the forest .
the sun would look at the petals like the the like glass , and if no have been , you would almost that we were the first people that are through these forest .
we came to our the .
i saw the little hut on a cliff and a across a the , beautiful , as something called horrible .
behind the roof , a one , maybe four - square , with the , the and a old the .
i was amazed , i was angry and i was confused .
the were to the , what they had -- who were , would they would to them ?
the question was asked me and i asked them : they were them .
who we to us ?
how do you also it or where " might be , who are behind us behind us in istanbul ?
who 's the behind us in rio or in paris or london ?
here in new york new york the , every day of day was tons of tons and 2000 tons .
i wanted to find them -- as individuals .
i wanted to understand who job the job .
how is it wear to wear a uniform and wearing it ?
so i started a with a with a .
i went to the , the and went to and went to offices and in the city , and i learned a lot , but i was still a fabulous .
i had to go to deeper .
so i took a job as a .
i was not just the i was the .
and i was the mechanical the and the snow .
it was a wonderful privilege and a exciting experience .
everybody asks after the .
he 's there , but not as you think , and on days , it really bad , you 're pretty quickly .
and you 're just to you can just hard .
i know people who were this number of years , whose bodies were still to weight her body , tons of every week .
then there 's danger .
after statistics of the the , the is the job in the under the 10 of the jobs in the country , and i learned why .
you 're all the entire day , traffic , all over .
all want to and often do n't have to .
this is really bad for workers .
and the garbage itself is full of the who was from the the and terrible .
i learned about the the of the the .
if you look from the the , and from the of the city of a city , you can see that the is like a self - itself .
he does n't stop to .
it 's also like a kind of or the .
he has to be in motion .
and then there 's the stigma .
you put the uniform and , somebody -- whatever -- whatever -- whatever you 're going to get you traffic or your a , or you 're going to close to your apartment , or you can and you and you and
i find this particular because i believe in the fact that the staff of the most important in the streets of city . that 's three reasons .
they 're the of the health .
if you do n't waste the waste , every day and efficient , and it would take out of the the and the and the would continue to us on very .
diseases that we 've been achieved and decades and control , and would spread and us .
the economy needs it .
if we do n't take the old , we do n't have a place for the new , the motors the of the economy to the , the is the .
i do n't know the capitalism , i just only the .
and then that 's what i call our , .
so i just do just how fast we 're today movement .
we do n't care about ourselves , our , or we 're going to
we take them , throw away , forget , because we know people on the other side , which is about .
so , i want to share a today of some ways today , how we think about thinking about how to improve and them into those entertainment how you create a city that are sustainable and .
your work , i think , is kind of the .
you see the streets every day , regularly .
they carry in many cities .
you know when you can expect it .
and your work does make us do our .
they 're like a the - .
the that they , us ourselves before our , our the , and this has to be more and to any price .
on the days , i 2001 the of a on the street , and my son of son and ran the and there was a man who his , he it every .
and i tried to work him for him work -- that day , all day days , but i started to cry .
and he looked at me and said , " everything 's fine . "
" everything is fine . "
first later , i started to my research and the husband .
his name is the and we worked together , we finally , we had good friends .
i wanted to believe that the was right .
everything is good .
but in our efforts , change way we at this planet as we need to be , we need to cost all the cost , including the very cost of work .
and we have to be informed to help people who do this work , how we think about how to systems about , which is a tremendous success of the united states and countries , and to us to a different species of waste that are can be transformed by
the more fundamental , we think when we talk about , three percent of the national .
it 's a remarkable statistic .
in your daily , in your life , your life , if you see next to see whose job is it 's behind them , take a moment time you 're .
take a moment to get it .
hello , what , what goes ?
that 's not enough .
hello , what , what goes ?
my name is the , and i 'm not drunk , but the doctor in my birth already .
he 's six my six directions , and me little , the air .
so i what i learned , what i means i 'm going to do all the time .
look at that .
it 's a . i 'm a of , and .
and it 's not genetically .
it 's not a the . you ca n't get it .
nobody has the of my mother 's , and i did n't get it because my parents are so much what they are .
you get them through accidents , like the who was born in my birth .
i have to warn you . i 'm not a source of inspiration , and i do n't want anybody to me with me because you all have been in a point in your life .
and just comes to .
it 's just christmas in the . and you see the looking at the looking for a and what you see ?
the .
and you think , " why ca n't i be a little bit ? "
i have to say you , i 'm problems , and i 'm only one of them .
if there was a the of the , i a .
i 'm a the , and i live in new jersey .
now if you do n't feel better , then i do n't know .
the park in new jersey is my hometown .
i love the fact that my and my have .
and also , i love the fact that i could go home from my home new york city , if i wanted to .
many people do n't run with hot , but my parents not n't ca n't do n't . "
the mantra was my father : " yes , you can . can . "
so if when my three older sisters , i with .
if my three older sisters on school , my parents to , so i could go , and if we were not all the , we all the the of my mother .
my dad was taught me when i was five by my feet on his feet and just the .
another of his was to put a camera of my nose , so i them to .
my inner was very strong , and as -- yeah , so , the first day i was , i was like a the who had a .
and then there was only six only in my city in my city and all my family were my family .
today we have 20 countries in the city , and they 're still all my family .
i think no one has ever noticed that we do n't have a .
this was before 9/11 before and before it took it for a , " i hate to use as a .
people i grew up with , did n't have with my faith .
but they were very concerned that i could possibly maybe could .
i explained that i was from three months three months , so i was the from the to a .
i have the .
yes , on the , it 's crazy .
my parents could n't afford to afford , and they me to the .
i learned how to build on the , so i can walk on .
and i 'm from the , where it really important to be , so when my , if i had my own , i also .
and if my friends their the coast of the coast of the , i do n't .
i spent my summer in a summer because my parents were afraid that we if we could n't get every single every summer , day , will be like .
the the often that my dad wanted me to me , so i was milk of the , and i was going to the dead of the water , and i the , and i thought , " it worked ! it works !
but we found a the , : .
i have to say it 's really boring , but before i did , i was a - old , who ca n't even be .
now , i can stand on the head .
my parents always me that i was able to make sure that not was not impossible , and my dream was to be the general .
because of the , i got a great scholarship on the university of the who had the university state , because i every minority of .
i was kind of the the of the the .
all me .
i do n't know all the way to do so much , got all of my , in all their the .
every time i a scene from the , my teachers .
but i never got a role .
so in my the , the the piece of the title " she dance into a really slow .
a piece of a girl with a .
i was a girl with .
so i everywhere , " finally , i get a role !

finally !
thank god , thank i 'm free ! "
i did n't have the role .
the brown had got the role .
i went to the the of the , i the , when someone had my cat , and she asked why she said me , " i n't the .
i said , " sorry , but if i ca n't , if you ca n't do it , " ca n't do it . "
i was born for this role , and she gave them a without a .
college the life .
hollywood is known for physically healthy .
after i went back to my first role was as a the in a the .
my dream was true .
and i knew i was soon to get out of the "
but instead , i stayed a the that was only the , and i realized that the did n't have a , .
they only perfect people .
but you know the .
i grew up with the , the and all these women had common : they were the .
so i became a the .
my first job was to first , to york city new york city , and i 'm never going to face the face of the , forget , was that the streets to new jersey , with a with a the of the .
i am in all across the united states , i 've also been in the east , and the .
some people say , i 'm the first - in the arab world .
i do n't want to ask the first , but i know that you never heard about the bad little bit that women are not , and they find us .
2003 , my brother from mother , father , dean the , and i was the new york new american that i already have to be .
and the goal was to the most exciting image of americans from the and to about the times that , and that is not .
the of the was much more than the challenge , the against the .
my great breakthrough was in 2010 .
i was been to the in the the " the " the .
i was like to the the the , she was me into a studio and i sat me a chair .
so i looked at the the , and i said , " sorry , i get another other chair ? "
and she looked at me and said , " five , four , three , two ... "
and we were live !
so i had to make the table on the table of so i was n't feeling the from the screen , and when the interview was finished , i was .
there was my chance , and i had her , and i knew that i never me back .
but mr. the invited me , but me , me a and my chair .
at work with keith , i 've learned , i all the internet .
people say , kids are cruel , but as a child or adults , or never been me about me .
in the world of web , i 'm my of my the .
if i look at online , i see like , " the , why are you like ? "
" the , is the the ? "
and my favorite : " the .
did it ?
we should be for them . "
and even , even my in the the : the , the , the ,
a disability is as visible as it 's like .
if a ca n't play , ca n't play .
the are the biggest -- yes -- yes , it 's a worth value .
people are the most the largest minority in the world , and we are the the in the .
the doctors said , i never walk , but i 'm sitting here .
but i would be with social media , i would n't be here .
i hope that we can put together a image of in media and create .
maybe there 's no way to the internet when it more positive .
or maybe not .
maybe it 's still a village to a child .
my journey with the me a few of very special places .
i put on the red next red next to the and the the .
i to a film in a film with adam and with my , which is called great - based .
i 'm as a the with the the - the - to - around the world .
i was the of the great new in the national center .
i 've been a the 's " , a the , who tries to try to provide the to of a chance that my parents my me .
but the one moment that the most -- before this -- the moment that i when i first before the man , how a and a like a bee of the , the way , and i 'm , .
this was the only time ever to me , and i was going to talk to this talk .
: god your soul your , dad , dad . my name is the , " if i can , you can also that . "
there was a time we 've been big problems .
on the 21st , july was the from the apollo and was the on the sea of the ocean .
armstrong and the were alone , but their presence on the was the of the the of a the , the .
the was the largest in the history of the united states of america .
to the moon , nasa , about billion dollars worth , worth , four percent of the the .
apollo created for 400,000 people and the the collaboration of 20,000 companies universities and universities .
people died , including the of the apollo .
but until the end of the end of 24 , 24 people , people .
from the that its surface , it 's the , after death , last year , now .
but why did they go ?
they did n't go back , and the of the , and , and something which all the 24 later -- a new sense of that our home is small and small .
why did they go ? the , they went , because president had wanted to show the that his nation had the better .
but the on words on the university of the university of a .
for the , was n't just a victory of the west over the east during the cold war .
at the time , this was a feeling of feeling of the about the forces of technology .
it was off to moon , because it was something great .
the the - in a long - of series of technological the .
from the first half of the 20th century , the and the and the and , and a vaccine against .
in the middle of the century , polio and smallpox .
technology seemed to be something that what 's called the a " the . "
for most of the human history , we could n't even faster than a horse or a boat with a , but in the year , the apollo was 10 miles about 10 miles per hour .
since 1970 , no have been human on moon .
no one has faster than the of the apollo , and the optimism is about the power of power technology , because the big problems we had to technology , to clean , or to the world to the world , to seem
i remember as a the as a the .
the of the apollo 17 saw me and my mother me not very to the very the of the the .
i had a idea that this was the last , but i was sure that there was still in my life on mars .
the the , something with our ability to be big problems with technology , become a become a .
you hear it everywhere .
we 've heard it in the last two days ted .
it 's a that of us having a of us and ourselves with the , with , and things like things and social media and social media , or algorithms , the .
it 's nothing wrong with these things .
they have our lives and .
but they do n't solve the big problems of humanity .
what happened ?
there 's a the explanation from silicon where you have that in recently , in less than chinese , than in years , intel , intel , microsoft and apple .
in silicon valley , you are markets , in particular special of , which companies .
silicon valley says that of course , that way to have to engage , and , and problems .
but this explanation is not good enough .
it explains mainly what does n't do n't .
even their times , small little , tiny , a 10 years 10 years .
investors had always been to invest in technologies like energy , which is a carbon and development and development and , never ever been the development of technology that have no value .
no , the reasons why we ca n't solve a big problem , complicated and more .
sometimes we do n't consciously to not the big problems .
we could fly to mars when we want .
nasa has even a plan .
but to be a political decision of public , and that 's why it will never happen to
we 're not going to fly to mars because everyone thinks that there are be there on earth 's things that are done .
another time we can solve the big problems because our political are fail .
today , less than two percent of the earth 's earth from the , sources , like solar wind , wind and less than two percent , and the reason is very economically .
coal and gas are cheaper than wind and wind and oil is cheaper than cheaper .
we all want to alternative who can make the , but it does n't exist .
now it 's so , and all of all the same opinion , what national and international development , and mainly : mainly , in the development of development and development and a price for carbon .
but in the current political climate , there is no hope that the u.s. of the u.s. or the international the , and the international the .
sometimes , problems are problems that are technically by the .
it was been believed that the was the .
but 30 years of research have taught us that political impact .
technologies can things like systems like systems and , and , but it will be more , and there are no way to do it .
eventually , sometimes we 're going to get solutions because we do n't understand .
president , the was told to war , but you discovered that there are many of cancer , which most of the most effective against therapy , and only last years , be in the .
difficult problems are difficult .
it 's not true that we ca n't solve great problems with technologies .
we can , we have to have to have these four elements all the first of all politicians and politicians must be involved to solve a problem , have to solve the solution ; it needs to be a problem , and we have to understand it .
the the that led to a kind of metaphor for the ability to be able to solve the problems , these things .
but this is a model that in future .
it 's not the year - year - year .
there 's no battle struggle like the cold war , no politicians like john 's , who 's all and to a , and , and not a the of the like the of the solar system .
but in the , it was just end up to the moon .
he was only three days .
and it 's really the that it 's really a serious problem .
we are ourselves and the solutions are going to be the future to be .
god , it does n't be us to challenges .
thank you very much .
i want to you your eyes .
imagine you , you 're your .
so , the door , their color and the material made it out of them .
now , you get a group of the - on - on their front of their .
it 's a the - and you and you and you and your .
you to imagine .
they 're the up , and directly .
and then they all directly into your town .
bicycles , wheels , all the and the . and the down in the .
now , you have about the threshold of your in your , or what 's on the side of your brain , and , as the in the room .
the light seems to the .
it 's you from your desk from a the .
one horse .
you can almost feel like his blue gets your nose .
you the the the that it into the mouth .
go over to over the .
here you want to be your .
her clothes just the , she they said , " the of the " a time , " while she on your the .
now , i 'm going to your kitchen .
the floor was replaced by a yellow the , and it 's called the , the the , the the , and the the of " from the ' , " hand .
okay . now , open eyes .
i want to tell you about a very competition about every year in new york in new york city .
it 's called " the - the .
a few years ago , i wanted to talk about this of as a the of the and , who was the the of the the of the .
it was a bunch of new and some few of , and very and .
they 're looking at hundreds of numbers hundreds of numbers .
the learned of the names of and the of the of and
and it whole thing just in minutes .
they were the who the of a of a the - the .
this is crazy .
these people have skills .
i started to start with some of them .
this is ed , a guy who was out of england and there 's one of the the .
and i asked him , " ed , when did you notice that this particular ? "
and ed said , " i 'm not a the .
i just had a average memory .
everyone who 's here , you 'll tell you that she 's just a .
we all , we , techniques , to these incredible the , the two - two - two years ago , the same techniques that used to their to and , and the of to books .
and i just thought , " wow , how does it i have never heard of it ? "
we stood outside out of the the and ed , this wonderful , brilliant , and something funny said , says to me , " josh , you 're a american journalist .
you know , you know ? "
i said , " what ? what ? why ? " ? " ? "
" i 'd like to teach to teach you how to order to order a order of a the - the .
it would be the world prove that everybody can . "
i told him , " i 'm not , but i but i could teach me .
i mean , you 've got to start somewhere , right ?
and that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me .
so , i of the next year , i spent the only of the time to train my memory , but it 's also it to understand it and understand how it works , it works , and it can not be and what might be .
i have a lot of really interesting people .
this is , for example , this is , for example , is
he 's suffering under the and probably the worst memory of the world .
his memory is so bad that he does n't even be his the . what 's amazing .
although though it was so tragic , he in it , how much our memory our we who we are .
on the other side of the spectrum , i learned to the side of the spectrum .
i 'm the .
he was the most beautiful character in the movie film " film . "
we spent a afternoon to the public in lake city .
and i came back to a whole of flying over the memory , which was two years ago , and in the in the and in the in the .
and i was a whole bunch of interesting things .
especially , especially , me that there was a time to the to the memory , not nearly as much as .
there was a time when people were in their memory , it was the .
over the last few decades , we 've been a series of technologies -- from the to the the , the , the computer , the computer , the -- it always us , our memory , our memory human ability to
these technologies have our modern world , but we can change the same time .
they 've us , and i would argue that they have us to have us .
without the need to remember , sometimes it 's like we forget .
one of the last places of this earth , you still find people who still are passionate , and , and , and that is unique .
in fact , he 's not as unique , there are the like this around the world .
and this was me the , i wanted to know how these people do this .
a few years ago , a university at university london a group of the .
you wanted to know : is the structure or anatomy of your brains is different than the rest of us ?
the answer was : no .
are you smarter than we ?
she gave them a the , and the answer was : actually did n't .
and there was a interesting and a interesting difference between the brain and a brain and a - and - a - and - a - and - a - .
if you put them in a and , brain , as you grow , and pictures of the , you can see that the other regions of the regions of the trees than the rest of us .
it seems like they 're using the part of your device using for the and .
why ? and can we learn from that ?
the to the memory of a kind of a - , which every year , every year , with a new technology to the a more of more and more and the rest of the rest .
this is my friend ben the , the .
on the table , front of the 36 , he the himself within an hour with an technology that he invented and as a .
he 's a similar technology around the of the of 140 of four - hour of in a half an hour .
yes . yes .
and even though it 's a of techniques to put things in these the , but they all the techniques on the concept that the psychologists called the .
this is so as about this concept , this is , : it 's like : if i look at two , to the same word , and you say , " the , " it 's a person called the . "
this is his name .
and you say , " well , you know there 's a person who 's a . "
now , if i go back to a moment now you back to you , say , " you know the word i 've ever been before you before ?
you know what you 've got ? "
the person who person the person who are the , more likely to be the word than the person who person the person who had to the person .
same word , things the ; it 's strange .
what is going on ?
well , the name of the means is nothing .
he 's absolutely all of all the the that in your head .
but the profession of the , we know .
so , white .
so , have a new on their hands .
smell good when they come home .
maybe we may even know a .
and if we hear that word first , we 'll use this whole word with the word and it later .
the secret of what in the , and the secret to be able to better things that can find the to of the to the of the , which is no matter , meaning in meaning in a way sense meaning
one of the most techniques can two 500 years back to the .
she was known as the known .
the story of his story is like : there was a poet called the who a the .
he was a for the conversation , because when you really wanted to really a really big , you , you , you a , but a
he 's his poem from the memory and the room , and the right the moment , the moment the line behind me and all the .
not only all dead , your bodies are to the the .
nobody one can tell anyone who was nobody , nobody knows where who has .
the body can not be properly .
it 's an tragedy after the other .
the 's outside , the only way of this is , he 's his eyes and suddenly he , he his front eye , his where .
and so he takes the the of the hand and it causes it the .
in this moment , something we all know that we do n't know how much bad we , we have , or , of our of our colleagues , we have a very good and memory .
i would ask you to first the first 10 words of history of the , so you find it hard to find it .
but i bet if i ask you , remember who remember standing in this moment on a moment - horse in your horse , your , you might have the .
the idea of the is to create a building of inner eye and it with the of the things that are -- the , the , the , the , the more of it as it 's .
this is a high - based on over two years old , when the memory is .
so how does it work ?
you 're invited to you to talk about ted talk , you keep it out of memory , as it would be done , he had been the to two years ago .
you 're just like this : you your .
imagine you 're crazy and crazy story with the pictures , and remind you that you first you about these crazy talks .
and then you put your house and you start the on the back of the .
and that would remind you to start your friend ed .
and if you look at color , you to a that you to tell .
you take into your kitchen , and the fourth thing you to talk was that strange journey for a year . and you 've got friends you to remember you remember .
so you know , this research did n't -- not word for word , word , but to subject on topic .
the english term " the , " which is the theme sentence , comes from the greek word " . "
these are some of those people when people about and in terms of
the " the first " actually " is " first in your " . "
i this was just fascinating and i 'm still a fascinating and i 'm just
some of the .
i wanted to write something about this the of the the .
but there was a problem .
the problem that the are the are .
it 's like a group of people who sit and write a test .
it 's already exciting when somebody who are the .
i 'm journalist , i need something to write about .
i know that the of things in the people in this people , but i do n't access .
so if i wanted to tell this story , i had to me to their position .
and so i began to get every morning every 20 minutes 20 minutes before i started with my newspaper , i was something about .
maybe a poem or maybe a poem or a poem or maybe a poem or maybe a poem .
the name of a old - old that i bought on the the .
i had to know that it was a fun .
i could never imagine .
it 's fun because it 's not about to train memory .
you 're always better , these crazy , and hopefully images from your mind 's eye .
i 'm at it .
here i am with my the .
a few of and a the that were up to two small two of because the enemy of the the .
i went to the same i used to year a year after a year .
and i 'm interested in this , just as an experiment .
it could be a nice - for my .
the problem was that the experiment did n't like that .
i won the , what , which really , should n't have should have .
it was nice to and , and , and it was n't what i wanted to do .
that 's just tricks .
tricks the work because they were on some simple ideas the of our .
you do n't need to build a - or - to - to - to - to - to - to - to - can - to - can - can .
we often talk about people with memory , as it was a special , but it 's not true .
good - are the .
we 're going to better if we 're .
we remember we 're getting .
we , if we have the possibility of figure out why information and experience are about , why they have meaning and , when we can them into something that 's sense in our sense of the , we can the "
the the , these the , they all .
in fact , it 's not real .
they work because they work us to work .
they 're us to be and , in a way we 're not usually .
but it are not shortcuts .
that 's how things are important in memory .
one thing i want to do you is something that i 'm through , which man who does n't have to be remembered , learned , our lives are our lives of our memories .
how much are we willing to lose our lives , that we our , or instead of telling us who are we to lose , because we are so lazy that we do n't have the and ?
i learned that memory , in any of us , has incredible .
if we want to live a life , we have to be the person who do n't remember .
thank you .
at the age of 27 , i went to a job in the the of a the , and teaching .
in public schools in new york i on math .
as every teacher i , i and tests and
i was homework .
when the work , i , i .
and in fact , the was n't the only difference between the best and worst students .
the , i some of my students were not the .
some of my kids do n't really well .
it was me .
in fact , in the , in , in math , is difficult : numbers , the , the area of a .
but not n't these concepts these concepts , but i was convinced that all of my students all students all the students to learn , and they worked hard and hard .
after some years , i went to conclusion that we had a much better understanding for students , students learning from a perspective of motivation , from a psychological perspective .
what we do is in the best measure is the natural , but what if in and in life , life much more than the ability to learn and easy to learn ?
so i went the classroom and i a to .
i started to kids and adults in all sorts of all kinds of different situation , and i wondered who 's successful and why ?
my and i went to the west .
we were trying to what the would be the , and which would n't .
we went to national and the to what would be .
we studied the that were worked in very tough very , and asked them what teachers were going to the of the , and they were able to improve their students .
we were partnerships with our and , who are their to their .
and who would make the most money .
now in all these different ways of looking at an individual of an effective of success .
it was not intelligence .
it was n't good physical , and it was n't .
it was brilliant .
and is and passion for a long term .
it is the .
and is , when you look at a the - , not just a week , a month , but for years , really hard to this plan .
you know , life is like a marathon . not the .
i started in public school in chicago in chicago .
i asked thousands of students of the , and the , and then they would come over a year to see who was made .
it showed that kids with kids were kids to the more difficult , even if i can all the properties things like , results , even tests , even as they did in the school .
so , do n't only have in and , but in school , but in school , especially for children .
the of this topic is me that we know so much that science as little as we it .
every day , my parents ask me and teachers , " how do we study kids of children ? "
how did i teach a ?
how do i going to for them for ? "
the answer response : i do n't know .
what i know is that you do n't have to be in their .
our data show that many of people are not going to remain to .
in fact , we do n't necessarily our most strong activity , but it 's also the talent .
so far the best idea that i 've been learned from the of the , is called the the - attitude .
this idea was been at stanford by the and the that the ability to learn to learn not to , but it can change their change .
dr. the showed that when they read about the brain , learning how it 's to and how to change and how much more likely to do , much more likely to do , because it is not a failure condition .
this is posture is a great idea for the of .
but we need more .
i want like to finish my , we 've already so far .
this is the work that lies us .
we need to best our best ideas and .
we have to whether we succeeded , we have to be willing to have to have to have to have lessons and learn from .
in other words , we need to be able to give kids .
thank you very much .
in the middle of my work is the connection of our lives and part of the environment , architecture from the natural , local conditions and traditions .
today , i 'm as example of example , projects .
both of projects are in , in ethiopia and one in tunisia .
they also have common that the different from different perspectives are a part of the brain of architecture .
the first example started a invitation , a the - in - in - capital in capital .
this is the kind of building that us , my team and me as an example of what we should be shown .
first of all , i thought i wanted to .
after we saw some of these buildings -- there 's many of them in the city -- we that they have found three of their .
first , these are these buildings , they 're very large , they 're very large , where people do n't afford to buy things .
second , you need a lot of energy because it 's the surfaces from glass , which heat inside , inside , and then you need a lot of
in a city , should n't should n't happen , because they have pretty weather that 's been 25 to 20 to 25 .
and thirdly , their nothing with and ethiopia .
this is a place in a place called a rich culture and tradition .
and also , i was really the first really of the old the old market with this old market with where these people , and thousands of people , and to , in every day .
it has also this idea of space that uses the uses of activity to create activity .
so i thought that 's exactly what i really want to design , not a .
but the question was , how we could create a the - building with these principles .
the next challenge came to we were to the , because it 's in a right - of town in the city , most of the buildings that you were on the image , not there .
it 's between two between that have across a hundreds of meters .
first we created a connection between these two streets , and then all the of the building .
this is a - the - , which creates a - in the building , which itself its own shape and sun and rain .
so to take this the , we the idea of a with a little that in every , because of the shape of the change , because of the change .
i also , how do we close to building ?
i really wanted to find a solution to the local .
i started thinking about think about how a of out of concrete in the , which the air , and the light , but in shape .
then i this these beautiful buttons in the the .
they have the properties of a geometry and helped me to the entire .
we 're building this with these little , the that air and light in into the buildings .
and this is through these little , the little bits that light the light from the to building the building at building a building .
it was n't just the to with the ideas , because they thought , " this is not a not - made , that did n't have . "
but then we realized that this idea of the is a much more than the idea of a , because they can do more .
and the concept of the was a much , much not a lot of the material , but it 's because we had no longer .
so we created some the - that we used to project .
the first time was to think about how we could make the building , in a city , almost a daily day .
we created a contribution by taking on the roof .
and under those the , we this as a new space , with space and , which that this .
these - on the roof the water into the .
hopefully , at the next year , because we have the to five 5 .
the second example is a the - in 2000 in the and in .
so to be a big project the project i had ever designed , i had to understand the city of really , but also the environment , tradition and the culture .
as this analysis , i particular on the , this is the 1,000 - old structure that was been by a wall , through 12 , and by nearly by the .
when i first came to the first , first started to build existing to create the first 12 of , with large size and like in and other cities in cities .
so , we some of the points in the at the of these and they with straight lines , and the changed the original pattern .
the last step was thinking about the cell , the entire cell of the project , as the as the as a part of the the .
what the best in a climate is for a apartment ?
this is the , because the between the two the , which created , and natural .
so we put a pattern about the that most of the most that are in this direction .
and this is the result , it 's almost like a combination of a european and the arab city .
there are the with and in the , these are all these sorts of things .
it also local that would increase higher density in the upper and a lower density in the .
it also the concept of the .
and this has this shape , which has been different through three different , and it into very dense light into the ground , and the three , three different , a and a and a nearby of a of activity that
this roof , my the project in this project , the community is almost the to the building .
there can all neighbors and things and make things like a the on the morning , from a building to another building .
these two examples have a common approach to the brain .
they 're in which you can see cities .
in cities , the changes of architecture in the today and future life will create the local communities and the as buildings .
and this reason , i think it 's important architecture , but , solutions , the relationship between the community and the environment , and the on the and connecting .
thank you very much .
i want to talk about trust , and i want to talk about the opinions .
they 're so ubiquitous to they become used to become .
there 's this view of my view .
first of all : trust is strong in , many .
then we goal , we should trust .
and a task is , we should rebuild the confidence .
i believe the claim that the goal and the challenge of the wrong on false ideas .
i want to give you a different story about a claim , a goal and a better approach to the right .
first of all : why do people think that is more ?
and if i really talk to my talk , i know , i do n't know the answer .
maybe it in some , or some , or some , in some of .
i 'm not going to .
but i can look at the surveys of the that the are the source of faith that believe that it 's a .
look at a look at a period of a , not a lot of .
and will be people who people 20 years ago , mainly journalists , and , still .
and the people who was very about 20 years ago , still very , very , : the , nurses .
we 're other people between the , by the way , the average almost in the middle .
but is that a good proof ?
the -- .
what could you do that ?
so you look at the general attitude of people when you 're asking certain questions .
trust politicians ? trust ?
now , if you asked somebody , trust ?
trust it ?
trust it ?
and then would you 'd probably ask , " well , " ? "
and that would be a reasonable response .
and if you answer the answer to you , you might say , " i 'm not some of you , but i do n't . "
it was rational .
in short , we 're in our short lives , we 're in different ways .
we do n't think of it that we every of a or in a or in a .
so i could say about that i had a particular of my , the first class , i would n't want to make the .
maybe i know that i know that she does n't have well .
i was that my friend a on running , but maybe not that she was a secret .
simple .
so know , from our everyday , how different trust can look , but why do we know this knowledge when we think about trust ?
the situation are doing a very bad about the actual system , because they ignore the sense of the that you 're in the .
second , we get to target .
the goal is to trust more confidence .
honestly , i think i think is the .
i would n't going to be .
i would try to trust the more of the , but not n't .
i 'm not allowed to do it .
and those who have your their into hands of a certain event who would like the name , so that made out of the dust , " he , " i , i think , " much , much more confidence .
" trust is not a the goal in this life .
trust and to should be the goal .
and then you say , yeah , okay , what is the most important is not trust , but it .
the people can people .
and to do that , we need to look at three things : we need three things .
are you ? are you ? are you ?
if we can a person in the of , and , and we can find , we have a good reason to trust , trust , they 're .
but the person is n't , but probably wo n't .
some of my friends are and i , i would n't make them letter , because they are the .
i have friends who are very in their own , but they 're , but they 're .
and i 'm very happy about that i did not have a lot of friends that are and , but are .
if you did n't have it .
but after that , we 're only , trust .
trust is the reaction .
the we have to do that . that 's of course , is hard .
over the last decades , we 've tried to design the in all sorts of and experts and experts and that it make us easier to save their lives .
many of these systems have the effect .
they do n't work .
and once a said to me , " the problem is that the longer takes to take the baby to the world . "
everywhere in our public lives , in our institutions , our institutions , our this problem , and this is to and , but it leads to the opposite .
it 's people like people 's their tasks by taking them to .
i can , any of can any of .
so 's what the goal .
the goal is more , and that 's difficult to be if we want to be want to want to communicate and other and if we want to whether we want to be whether or , or , or politicians ,
it 's not easy . you have to do it . simple reactions or not n't do n't .
and now to the task .
this as the as of describe , the .
because it suggests that you should trust and trust .
we can do that for ourselves .
we can win a little bit more .
so , two people can improve their confidence .
but ultimately , it 's a that it 's being done by one of another .
you ca n't build the again what else do .
you have to give you a give you a trust .
so you have to be .
and that 's , of course , is that you do n't usually all of people at the nose at the nose .
but they also need to have older that they 're .
how does this ?
this happens happening every day , everywhere . people do doing , very effective .
here 's a simple example of .
the store i my , i put them up and they ask no questions .
they take them back and give me back to me , or a few of the in the .
this is great . i 'll show you , because you 've showed me .
there 's a morality .
you think of the as vulnerable , it 's a very good sense that you 're being , and you 're to your own .
so our goal is not really to very difficult .
it 's relationships between people , and the the , and if the other is different .
so the morality of history is much less much about trust or about faith , the of the or the , and much more about , and how you people , and evidence of the own .
thank you .
you know , the best thing i 'm most best for me is the films i can look .
i love my own my own my with my kids , when my daughter was four years old , we together , " the of . "
the film has n't longer .
her the was the .
so she had a good excuse , a dress , and a the .
but if you look at this film , you look at , you see , it 's actually .
we live in the today and our children in a kind of a - a - a - .
but " the was by .
he did n't have this trend .
it has 40 years to this trend , -- a different movie , which guy a guy from a and a guy with a girl , by the of the of the .
you know what i 'm talking about , right ?
right .
well , there 's a big difference between these two films , even several differences between the of and all the movies that we are today .
first of all , there are in the ' of very violence .
the monkeys are pretty aggressive , as the the .
but i think if the had of the by the , today , who would have said , " the , " the , you are the the of that we 've been once .
use your own shoes to order to read computers by the end of evil of the . "
but it does n't happen .
another point i 'm at the " visual of " is very unique , is that the and even more characters .
this is what i first time when i was my star , " and was , years later , and was different .
at that point , i had a son .
he was at the time three years old .
he was n't invited to this , he was he too .
but he was the second child , and he was less than his sister .
so he 's a , and he 's the movie , he 's a the his mother , and i do n't think he 's understood what he was going on , but he it was safe in the .
and i wondered what he got there .
he said that it 's courage , and ?
he the that a army to the government ?
he that there 's only in the universe , and then , of course , who these who are really cool , so that the with a and a the , to the , the he was doing with the
compare this with the ' of " .
how does your the your film to a good end ?
by all the the and a the .
this is the kind of world i my rather -- , or -- and in the world , who are struggling , which is pretty much of our today .
why does it so much -- big -- in the movies that are doing our children , and so few of the the ?
there 's a lot of good literature about the impact that about the boys of the boys , and they should read them . they 're very good .
but i did n't read much about that guys with this .
i know from a experience that the could n't the model that i could have to find the world of adults , and girls in girls and common .
i think there was this moment with the first kiss when i really , that the was going to , the , so that 's a movie ?
i my mission , i to girl .
why do you see there ?
i do n't know what to do .
the movies are very to the and their heart , and there are n't a lot of space for other relationships and other travel .
it does almost like as a young animal is a and animal and if you 're a girl , you should better get your the .
there are exceptions , and i 'm going to show the the of any of you .
but they give a message to the young kids that boys are not the the .
they 're the to teach girls how to the the , but they do n't show the boys to the they 're going to
there 's no way for them .
there are also some women who are writing to write our stories for our kids and also , are still more the .
and the most common of all the of the animal is a after the other , and every single one of them , a young man or a two of two men who are friends , or a son and his son , two men who have
until you -- many of you think of -- when you when the movie the movie -- the - the - the .
i recommend him all of you . he 's on the internet .
remember , what the said , " the ?
" oh , i ca n't believe that has made a the machine . "
it 's very good . do n't take it that .
but as well , none of these movies has the .
i do n't know if you 've heard of it .
it does n't have to this right , and on , but maybe we 're going to start a today .
the is a the and in the middle of the this , that she with a friend of the films that had seen .
it 's just very simple . there 's only three questions you need to be there is more than a character in the movie , which is the , and it 's something ?
try to get that .
and talk about women in the of the time ?
and what 's in their entertainment is something else , the guy , they like ?
thank you .
thank you very much .
two women who exist and talk about anything .
this is what happens . i saw it , and yet i see it 's pretty much in the movies that we know and love .
in fact , i went to this week in to see me a very good movie , " the . "
you remember ? a lot of the at the the , great the , an general sense of what a good - is a good - .
it falls with the through the the .
i think that should n't because of the of the -- i do n't know if you 've seen it -- but a of the 's playing in a message where men and women during the the .
there are some good scenes in men in this deep , of fear , and , and the great moment , one of the the , is to go through door and say , " you go bed ? "
this is some of hollywood .
so let 's look at look at the numbers .
in 2011 , under the 100 of movies , what do you think how many of these were actually female ?
11 . that 's not a .
it 's not as many of the number of women who we just in congress , so , that 's good .
but there 's a number that bigger than this is and this is this is this space .
last year , the new york times published the government .
you that you 're saying that you 're saying that
one of five women in the united states that they 've been sexually to their life .
i do n't think that 's the general .
i do n't think that the have to do anything .
i do n't think that and directly to do something , but something 's going , but if i hear this statistics , one of the things i think that is a lot of the .
who are these guys ? what are they doing ?
what do you do learn to learn ?
take your story in that , it 's the task of a male , the the violence and then the , and the , who does n't have friends and not talking about it ?
so let 's take this story ?
you know , as a parent that privilege , a daughter , as the same of you do , we do this world and these statistics very and we want to .
we have a like " the , and we hope that help , but i 'm also wonder whether it 's going to be , when we 're at the same time , active or , our , our , "
the the is a means that we can do something very important , and i 'm talking to the .
i think we need to do our just a new idea of the - class .
the definition of the is already is changing .
you read the new york of the of the and the .
they 're going to the .
our sons will find a way to adapt to new relationship , and i think we really have to show you that a is man is his sisters and on their side , and really the bad guys who are men who want to
i think we should be looking for the movies that are the , if we find them , and looking for the search that are the real people that people together and to those with these the , " i 'm on side
when i was my daughter who " who " you know what they said ?
the .
the and the and the .
what did these two common together ?
maybe it 's not just the most dress .
i think these two figures are experts .
these are the characters in the who know more than others and their knowledge to with other people to help them help their potential of their potential .
and they also leaders .
i like this kind of job for my daughter and i like this kind of job for my son .
i want to do more tasks like this .
i want to tasks in my son , " and " and " and " and , and , and , and he , which is a to a team that will be to a , and help people better people , and better people , the of
thank you very much .
i want to talk to you about the story of a the .
i do n't know the name , but his story .
he lives in a small village in south .
his village is near .
the drought most the poverty of this village and the the .
when there was nothing more , him in the village , he his village and he went into town in this case , the , the capital .
when he 's there , there no options , no jobs , no way .
and at the end , he comes in a outside of the .
it may be a year , but nothing .
one day he will going to from a man who him to him , to dinner , to dinner ,
he 's this dynamic group young people and they give him a chance .
he gets a little money to buy new clothes to feed money and home to home .
it 's going to be young .
he finally . he .
he starts a new life .
his life has a sense .
on a nice day in the , the , walk into a straight in the air .
this the of the was the and the and dynamic group of young people were the to have a the with .
how could the story of a of just trying to in the to that it himself in the air ?
he had .
he had an opportunity to focus on the future , and a it was the first opportunity to him .
it was the first thing to call him the from a state that we call " the . "
and his story is always over again over the areas of the around the world .
it 's the story of the , urban - youth , who are in and london and something different than . "
young people promise from the city , from their the , jobs , work , but , but young people do n't have a lot of wealth .
it 's often the youth that are under the high .
in 2030 , three are five of five to five cities in 18 .
if we do n't young people in the growth of cities , if we do n't have opportunities , they 're " , the in the terrorism in violence in the .
in my the , the , suffering , 70 percent of young people are under unemployment .
70 percent do n't have work , do n't go to school .
they do n't actually do anything .
last month , i went back to the , i went to the the , where hospital where i was born .
i remember , i met this hospital , and asked me what if i was never going to be here ?
what if i had to the same condition of the " forced ?
would i be become ?
i 'm not sure what i 'm going to do .
the reason for this was in was in was a of a the of young leaders and entrepreneurs .
i was about 90 young leaders .
we sat together and we started a solutions for the largest challenges of their city .
in the room , a young man , the .
he went to the university in university and was his .
there was no jobs and no options .
i remember he said that he had a the , was frustrated , frustrated was the perfect goal , be member , and other .
they 're people like him .
but this story takes another different .
in the , the biggest obstacles are to from b to the streets .
23 years , the completely destroyed , so that the best is best .
and the did the opportunity and they .
he 's a .
he started to the the of the that could n't afford to could n't afford .
with his family and his friends , he 10 , and he 'll be able to get his at the point in the next three years .
how do you tell this story from the other ?
what makes the difference ?
i think it 's his ability to a new opportunity to use it .
it 's the the and i think that the the can be the means to be " - term . "
it 's the young people in the to create the economic opportunity that they 're so desperately .
you can teach young people to be entrepreneurs .
i want to talk to you about a young guy who one of my , : the , a the .
he helped me to the of some young people who people on the summit , and to show them how to build and .
he 's actually the first the that has been seen since the last two years , until before there was used to be the the , that was the by the ship from the from the , when you wanted to the on the wedding .
when you ask somebody , " when did you last time you ever seen the last time ? " then the answer was the answer of many who the during the of the , " never . "
so saw an opportunity .
he started a the with a .
he was a outside of the and started to the and the , which he could be in the climate .
he started to talk to the flowers , and he was private and to the town and he working on the of the first public parks in the last year .
there 's no public parks in the .
he wants to create a place where families and young people are together , and he says , he can teach the beautiful things about life .
just 's the : it does n't because it 's because you too much water .
so the first step is to young people to inspire , and in this room , the had a huge impact on the other young people in the room .
they never had really thought about it a company .
they thought for a work for work for government , but this story , but its , have a strong impact on it .
he the them to look at their place as a place of possibilities .
he the them in fact that they can be entrepreneurs that they could change .
so the end of the day , they were innovative solutions for some of the greatest challenges of their city .
they had the solutions to local .
the inspiration of young people , and the of a is a big , but people to capital their ideas to their .
they need the and to develop her business and develop .
they bring people with the resources that they need , they give them the support they need to ideas and they will going to make the for growth .
for me , for me , more than just a of a .
it 's about social .
the - sold sell just flowers .
i think he hope .
his design is " , when it created , the view of people change their .
the has the who to help him to and the .
he gave them the chance to get from the state of the the state of " . "
these young companies have a tremendous impact on their cities .
so my suggestion is , you young people to people , and their innovations and they 'll talk more about flowers and " instead of " and " . "
thank you very much .
so during my childhood , i was my favorite of my favorite , looking at the on the on the on the on the because my parents were , happiness .
but these are hard to find .
they 're from sand , barely .
but after a certain period , i had a developed a .
i started seeing , and patterns that helped me , they collect .
and this was to find a passion to find things that i think , for the and the .
and when i started studying , i realized that see that my eyes not eyes with my eyes .
because suddenly grew up in egypt in a of to a the miles , along the , and my grew up to the size of cities .
and that led me to use .
i had to see differently to see the past in a map .
so i want to show you how we example , we use .
this is a site that 's in the eastern called the .
and the appears - brown , we use it , but it 's with color , this is called the suddenly .
what you see here is the chemical changes of the landscape of landscape through the and the of the old egyptians .
what i want to share with you today is how we used to have used to build a city that the name of the name , and for thousands of years .
the was the capital of the old egypt , more than years , a called a rich , about years ago .
the is the in the and it 's very efficient , because it 's a in the middle realm of the arts , architecture and religion and religion .
and always knew that the the of the would be somewhere by the near the , from the two , with the red , but in this massive .
this area is huge -- it 's the number four times three times three miles .
at the same time , the directly to the the , and while , and his moves , changed and moving towards the west , town .
so how do you find a city in a .
they 're to find to be the equivalent to find the needle in the , with eyes and eyes .
so we used to the - to - a - map of the landscape to see able to see a , to see ,
where the of the of the used to be used .
but you see , and this is very interesting , this slightly the of , with the circle that we us as a possible position for the city .
so we worked with scientists to the , what you see here .
this is like the ice , except instead of layers , change , climate change , you can , human .
in a depth of five meters , under a layer of , we found a density layer of the .
so this shows that this position for the , in five meters , in five meters , we can find more over several hundred years of the , to the realm of the , to the the , which we the existence of existence
we found the -- the -- the and the -- and -- what i showed that here 's a .
it might not look at much , but if you look at the the stones , which were used by the in the rich , you find these rocks .
so we found a density layer of the the of these that are on the rich .
we also found evidence for a for the society , which shows that this is a very important city .
but there 's not a the , but we 're going to get back to this site , we 'll going to draw a map .
what is important , we have about young who are trained in the school , so they are able to make great discoveries .
so i wanted to be my with my own - , i was , maybe it was in the city of the , and years ago .
" knowledge to share is the biggest of all the .
there 's nothing in this in the . "
ted was n't 1984 .
ideas , have been in , but 1984 in 1984 , in a long , long , from .
you can do that at the top of the in the .
thank you very much .
thank you .
i grew up in taiwan as a daughter of a the , to my memories , like my , the and the form of chinese .
and i was , i was fascinated by this incredible language .
but for a , it seems to as the great wall of china is china .
so in the last few years , i asked myself , i can this , everyone anyone who have this to this , and also understand and .
i thought that was a new way of learning to learn chinese .
since five , i learned every single every single every single every single in the right .
in the next 15 years , i 've learned new every day .
because we have just five minutes to have a very difficult and simpler , and very difficult to have very useful .
a chinese the is about 20,000 .
you only need 1,000 thousand for a simple the .
the most 200 you to 40 percent of the simple literature , to -- enough to the and the and the of the time of the .
so today i start with eight to show you how the works .
are you ready ?
open your mouth as possible until it 's .
it 's going to be a mouth . "
this person goes to a .
" human . "
when the the for fire " a human with a , like if he was , " help ! " the takes the from the of the , but i like this .
this is a tree .
" tree . "
this is a mountain .
the sun is . sun .
the moon . "
the the for " looks like a the - from the .
these eight are radical .
they are the the to create a whole of .
a human .
if someone else somebody else , it says , " follow . "
it 's more , then , two " and " and " a " .
if a human his poor , says , " this man , " it was so big . "
the person in the mouth , it 's like .
he 's a " , " as the in the whale .
a tree is a tree two trees are a for a . "
three together are designed for " forest . "
and you put a the under tree , and you have a " . "
put it up a mouth up , it means " the . "
just to because a is a is a pretty the .
remember that fire ?
two black people are hot .
three fire together a lot of . "
put the fire under two trees , it "
for us , the sun is the source of the .
two together .
three together are together . "
when the sun goes and the moon together , it means "
in the context , it 's be for the next day .
the sun goes across the horizon .
door . a in the door stands the . "
you put a mouth in the door , it says , " ask questions . "
the , the . is somebody there ?
this person the from the door . " , " . "
the left is the woman .
two women are two for a " . "
and in three women , this is called " the . "
we have now 30 of .
and this method this method can take the first eight of words in the .
the next group of eight are together with other words .
with a little bit , you can learn a hundred of how a child - child .
if we can make these , we start them .
for example , it makes mountain and fire , and so it 's a "
we know , japan is the land of the sun .
this is the sun with the " , because japan is not a .
one is with the sun is called " japan . "
a human being is to ?
a japanese . "
the are the left are two mountains in the .
in chinese , chinese " , " chinese , their political chinese are sent in the dark of the mountains .
today , " to . "
a mouth says where it says , " . "
that 's the slide that reminded me to the stage . thank you very much .
