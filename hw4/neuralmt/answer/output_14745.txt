when when i was in my 20s , i had my first <unk> . . 
i was a and i was particularly in berkeley . berkeley . 
she was a a woman woman named alex . 
when the came came up the first first , she came up and she a a a , and she fell into the couch in my <unk> , , her her and and , and they me to to to <unk> <unk> . 
and when i was the , i was was . 
my <unk> received received received <unk> a a patient for first first . 
and i got a woman in the the , who wanted to talk to . 
i 'll leave that , i thought , . 
but i did n't have it . 
with the the stories , the alex with into the , , it easy easy to me me with just to to with the problems . 
" 30 is the new 20 " , " alex , and as far as i did , i had right . 
work came , <unk> , , came came , , came came came came , who came to death , death . 
people people in the the , and alex , and i did n't have time . 
but soon , my my , my head , to ask me . 
i i was going to . 
i said , " yeah , you know , you 're with your with your your with your with your with , but you 're not going to marry it . " 
and there said my my , " " , " not yet , but maybe you <unk> the the . 
<unk> is the best time to alex to work before before they married . " 
this is what psychologists call call a call . 
that was the moment that occurred that i did n't know the new 20 . 
yes , people people are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> - like <unk> , but did n't mean , did n't know the to . 
and so , the alex , , the , the , and we and we and and and and and it . 
and i realized that this kind of <unk> <unk> <unk> a a problem with real consequences , only only <unk> and and and and their <unk> , but but the , but , and the all the people and the people in the . . 
at that moment , there in the united states , 50 million people in the . . 
we talk about about 15 percent of the percent , or 100 percent , if you say that nobody did n't get the without without without going to go through the . . 
if you guys , if you are in your . . 
i i a couple of you . 
oh , yeah ! you 're all incredible . 
if you work with somebody , the , , , loves , because of the , i 'm you you you 'll see you -- -- -- <unk> . people -- in people in the , really , really important . 
my , my my are in people in the , because i think that every single million of you should know , psychologists and <unk> <unk> , the one of the most and and most things that you can do , the the , the the , the , ,
this is not my opinion . that 's facts . 
we know that 80 percent of the <unk> moments are to to to 35 . 
that means that eight of 10 decisions , , experiences and experiences that make out of your life , make it , , until you 're going to be , , 
do n't want to be if you 're 40 . 
this group is going to be fine , i think . 
we know that the first 10 years of a a a a a a , and how much money money . 
we know that 30 30 than the average americans of americans are married or or with the partner partner or or a partner . 
we know that brain brain is going to be the and and and , and in the the , and and the the the the the , , which means whatever you want to to you to you , to time to do this time . 
we know that the <unk> of the of the of the of of the - than - in - in - and - and and the the the the women the women with the their with with their their and and and to 35 . 
so in the , , , you should have <unk> <unk> and <unk> the the and and the your own . . 
when we think about the development of a child , we know we know that the first five years of years and and are are in in brain . 
it 's the time that the <unk> , life has a a impact impact on the future . 
but we <unk> little bit more little bit that there there 's something like like , and our our are a a time . 
but the people get people in the the the . 
the press the <unk> press the the of the . . 
scientists call the the of a a . . 
journalists , the <unk> people people in the the of like " <unk> " " or " " " " " . " 
that 's true . 
so , as culture , we have the what the the decade decade is the the . 
<unk> <unk> that that things things things things with a plan and a little bit little time . 
is n't that ? 
so what happens when you put someone in the the the head , and say , " you you , you you get 10 years to make a little bit of your life ? 
nothing . 
this person is the <unk> and the and the and it 's not nothing . 
and so every day , , people people in the the like like your your and and and into my my and say something like , " i 'm my friend , i do n't know , but that 's not the relationship . " 
or you say , " all , , as long as i 've done it for 30 years , it 's all all . " 
but <unk> <unk> it on , " my my my almost almost almost and i did n't have any . . 
i had a better fortune when i had finished college . " 
and then it looked like this , in my my , , like the . 
all the the had had and and , and then , , , and then 30 came came out of the music and and and began to to . 
i did n't want to be the only ones that i stayed . i i sometimes i , i i my husband , because he was in my my in the my chair . " chair . " 
where are the people in the in here ? 
does n't do that . 
ok , that 's 's easy to say , but not does n't make any sense , because it 's about much . 
if a lot of the the the in the , , there 's a enormous pressure to go through a a , a a city , a city city , a partner and two or two or three or three children in a much more . . 
and many of these things are more <unk> and like the , are just showing the <unk> and and and and so all all the time in the . . 
the does does n't mean to buy a red red . 
it means that you want to make the career you want to do . 
you you you you ca n't have this kid , you ca n't want to be able or or ca n't want to be able . 
too many people in the and and and and look at themselves and and myself and and say , " what , " did i have ? " what did i have ? " 
i 'm going to <unk> the <unk> , what people in the do do in the . 
this is a story that shows how it can . . 
it 's the story of . . 
and , my my when she was 25 , she she was like she had a <unk> , , a a . . 
she said she 'd like to work in the art art , or the , but she did n't even have decided that they had to <unk> in the last the last years . 
because the was was , she she with her friend with her friend who who more his his his than his his <unk> . . 
and even though their were were were , were their worse were still worse . 
they often often often in the , , but then she would be up and said , " your family could you , you , your friends . " 
one day , came very , and and almost almost all the hour . 
she had bought a and she and she spent the morning , she her her , , but then she came to the the the which came to the <unk> , " in the in the " 
she was almost <unk> when she came out and she said , " who 's going to be me if i have a accident ? 
who 's going to me me if i have cancer ? " 
in the moment , i had to to to to to say , " i " 
but the no no no no music , really really , really to . 
a needed a better life , and i knew , was was chance . 
i had had a lot of my my first time to to just how <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in in <unk> . 
and in the weeks weeks , and months , i was three three three three three three - three - , , everybody everybody , , or , or man , woman . 
one , i , i , , not not <unk> , , , but they 're a a a a . 
and i i , to to you , something that you 're to to . 
it 's something that makes you offer to offer , investment in something that what you want to be as a . . 
i knew knew knew that <unk> knew no longer , no no way to look at the the future of work , but i i : : <unk> <unk> . 
so now , the time time , this international job job this this , , this <unk> , which is trying to try . 
i do n't have the <unk> of the the of the but the the ones that are not not not are not not . 
this is <unk> . 
i said to to , , , the , but the , but but . 
second , i said , the urban urban is is <unk> . 
good friends are are are , to get to to the airport , but , , the people with people who are like to think about how they 're what they what they think they how to they to and how they work . 
this new new new this new person , the , the most of the from the of of the . 
new things are made of " " " <unk> " , so friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends friends
it 's true : the <unk> of of the is is not or not not . 
but the other <unk> , it 's not and and they have <unk> there . 
the jobs of jobs never never have . so if you 're the boss to your neighbors , your <unk> , your job . 
this is not a . . so 's how information . 
the last advice : what believed believed you could n't hold the family , but the friends . 
this is why they were when they were , but as soon , they soon their own their own , , they they a partner partner and a family family . 
i told her , time , a new family family , family now , 
you might think maybe that 's better better than you 're talking to 20 20 or 25 , and i agree to you . 
but the you you you you 're you or you live in your life , if everybody 's facebook on facebook , is not an progress . 
the best time to get your marriage before , before you have a , and that means that the the in the love in love love in love in your . . 
your family family family , means , consciously and the the , what you do , and not , because it works , or anybody with the time that you 're just right . 
so what happened to do ? 
we walked her and and found them the secret of a <unk> who was in in a different state in a museum . 
this weak band to to her , get a work . 
and this gave gave her her her her her her friend , her friend , she her her . 
now , <unk> years , <unk> , is is <unk> <unk> . . 
she has a man who has her . 
she loves her new new new and her family family , and she told me a card , which was " " now the the line is " in the , you 're not enough to " . " 
<unk> sounds like sounds sounds like this is just simple simple , but it 's what i love about love . 
it 's so easy to help them . 
<unk> <unk> are like <unk> planes planes that just left the the and and and somewhere to west . 
and after the the , , can make a little difference make the difference whether you 're in or or in in . . 
the the <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , a a great design , a great beautiful , a a very beautiful can can a tremendous impact for a and even even even generations . 
this is an idea that all all the to that should knows . 
it 's so simple to what i i to to . 
i 've the privilege to do this this as a every day : the the are not the new , , so you you on , you a a , , you use your your own your own family . 
you do n't n't know what you do n't n't , or not . 
your your your now now your life . 
thank you very much . 
in the entire industry , it was always our goal to connect the distance between and and the information , the most interesting between our physical world and the world on the screen , where we our our imagination . 
and this distance is smaller , smaller and smaller smaller smaller , and now it 's smaller than a millimeter that 's a a a a , and computers , and it 's <unk> . 
but i wondered how it <unk> it , , it 's not going to limit . 
i 've looked like what the look like . 
first first i 've this tool tool that i into the digital world , so if you put on on the screen , you it it the physical character . 
designers designers designers their ideas directly directly directly into the , and and and <unk> <unk> at the organs of the the . . 
so this tool , the tool was so the . 
but our still remain still still the the of of the . 
how do we <unk> with with the digital information and the the the the and the whole of our our ? 
in microsoft , i 've , with my mentor , <unk> <unk> , computer computer computer and a a little room of the keyboard in the digital room . 
so that that a apple screen and screen and the to the the of of fingers and face face , you can put its <unk> of the keyboard keyboard , the the the , and with with the the with the <unk> . 
there 's windows and and put a position in the room room , you can just it it as easy to make a book from a shelf . 
then you can through this book and and it and and and and , and all this this on the the of of the <unk> . 
architects are their their their their their their their two and and . . 
so in these two examples , we 're going to digital digital . 
but how how it once we take the whole and and the digital information that we us ? 
i 've sure many of you have already made to to articles articles online online . 
but now they do n't worry any more . . 
here i have a " <unk> . " 
this view of view of a a , you 're through a a or a <unk> , or the your system , the the system that 's the geometry system . 
this idea of this idea , i started to think that i think , the the not just in the space , but it it in the , so we could make them and and and and and <unk> . 
what what does a like a a future ? 
in mit media media lab , i 've with my my <unk> <unk> and my collaborators , and i 've been a a . 
now , in this case , this is is is like a tiny - in in our world , which means that computers and computers , to see this object object , the <unk> , within the small of of this tiny . 
effectively , we have the gravity and and control control the by by magnetic magnetic , , and and these these . . 
by adding the object , we we it through through the through through space through space and time , and then , a human movements movements , and and and and and in the real world . 
so <unk> - <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , or <unk> , , finally can finally can and and and again in the real world . 
<unk> <unk> use this use this to use complex concepts concepts and physics and physics and and , and a , or a , or a is a a and and experience that that can and and and and and and it 's very <unk> . 
and more than that , just what we have now in the computer , it 's to imagine how the the of the world is actually going to be our our <unk> . 
as they are , , , , digital digital information will not only us us to show us to interact with with us as part of our physical physical environment , without ourselves ourselves of our world . 
today , we 've begun by turning by the boundaries boundaries boundaries , but if we remove the limit , the only frontier is our imagination . 
thank you very much . 
i was been to to for two years to become a <unk> , in china , china , in the 1970s . 
when i was in the first grade , i wanted to get government government to school school school , , all the paid paid . 
but my mother said , " no . " 
my parents wanted to me to engineer . 
after they they the the , they they believed that the only way to make the safe and safer and a good job . 
it 's not important if i do n't have the job or or . 
but my dream was to be a chinese . . 
i 'm that i i on my my piano . 
a a has to do with a with with the start with so with the start , and so i tried to to try to go into the . . 
i wrote even the the the the and and the to the the of a . 
but the adult does n't give my idea . 
the adults did n't believe it was me to me . 
only my friends friends me , but but they also also as children , as as i am myself . 
and with 15 years i knew i was to old to to with with the training . 
so my dream dream never have to be true . 
i was afraid of fear that i could only take the rest of my life , only a second second . 
but that 's so that 's . 
so i had to look at the head , and i could find another . . 
no one there to me me , me well , too well . 
so i i decided to . 
i <unk> my hunger to <unk> <unk> , with a book , and " the <unk> of " <unk> , " i was my my in a a , , <unk> " <unk> " " " " " " " " " " in " in " 
[ " <unk> <unk> " ] " " " " " " from <unk> <unk> , i came to the united states , and what did i first read ? 
<unk> <unk> <unk> that china in china . 
" the good earth " " from life life of the chinese . . 
it 's just not just as propaganda . i understood . 
the bible is interesting , but odd . 
but that 's a subject subject . 
but the <unk> commandment gave me a kind of " , " " you want to your your father and your your mother . " 
" honor " i thought , " that 's so much and much better than " . " 
that was my way to way to to to and to and to the to to the to to my relationship to my parents . 
through with with a new culture , i started reading the reading . 
this is a lot of . . 
for example , i did n't like to map these card - , because because chinese <unk> with this this . 
it never never occurred to me that china does n't have to be in the center of the world . 
so a map is a a little bit more the the . 
the , the reading is is not new . 
in the academic world , it 's a <unk> . . 
there 's even <unk> like like <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> . 
comparison and <unk> <unk> a a a a a a . 
so i thought , if if you read reading reading in the research , why does n't it live in the ? ? 
so i began to read the two simultaneously simultaneously at the same time . 
they <unk> people from people act , " benjamin franklin " [ " john john " " david " by david , who was the same same , or or friends with with with with their experiences . 
[ " we " we know , " " " " " is life is a <unk> of of the , , , and , and the stories of the , in the , , joseph , " joseph " ] and and <unk> , and had to had to
in were in the , the the the , the political and political nature . 
they were all they were all nature , , , , and social social , , and . 
if you make a a , , it makes it to to read the <unk> in two languages . 
[ " <unk> <unk> " a " <unk> " " the the of the water <unk> the the <unk> of " " " " " " " " " <unk> " instead of me me in the , , i figured out how much i i can . 
i think , by <unk> , i think , " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " means " " 
" " " in chinese chinese means " new mother " . " 
<unk> are <unk> like me a a a . . you through a connection to the people and the present . 
i i i that i never never myself , or i 'll be <unk> or <unk> . 
a dream dream dream is really really nothing compared to what many many other . 
i came to the <unk> that it 's not the only purpose of a hard to be true . 
his his purpose is is to make us to the <unk> , where where where where our our passion and our our . 
even a dream dream dream can dream this this . 
because of the , i 'm here today , today , , with a with a purpose in life and with with a very happy time . 
<unk> <unk> always always with with . 
thank you very much . 
thank you very much . 
thank you very much . 
when i was eight years old , a new class was in the class , and she was so amazing to be as as new as always always . 
she had had a hair hair and and a little <unk> <unk> , was was in in and and . 
i was in in , i i until i had a a plan plan . 
so i stayed a day of school , school , a lot of <unk> , and i was in the the the . . 
when the air was was , i came into , i went into into the classroom , i took the <unk> of the the . . 
and then i did . 
i <unk> the notes of my <unk> , just just some some few . 
all the <unk> . 
when i wanted to book the book , i noticed that that some of my other had had to be pretty good . 
so i i in the all of the , , , no . 
i gave all all of all , and i myself myself , because i was because i was also all the time . 
i 'm still still more <unk> - my behavior . 
i do n't understand where the thought came came . 
i do n't understand why i did so so good . 
i 'm really good . 
i do n't even know why i never never been . 
it was so obvious . 
i was never caught . 
but most most , me , why why why so so so that that this little <unk> was so good in the ? 
i 'm <unk> . 
it 's so so , , , . 
we know that babies are under under suffering . 
similarly , primates . <unk> are inherently from nature . 
we know that the the of the <unk> is among among among among among in the united states . 
but i never never a study study that i could their their or their their or their their their . 
and , we <unk> , we to the literature , because because novel is the lab that the the in the in the in their their forms . 
is it a <unk> saying saying that if we do n't have a , , we we not literature literature literature ? 
so no do n't have a <unk> , , " no " . " 
no <unk> <unk> , no " " from the night . " 
no shakespeare . 
because , as the <unk> of the the , , we , " and and " " " " " " " " , " " " <unk> " " " <unk> <unk> , " 
no no , no no , no <unk> . i i think it 's in to say that the answer has everything has , but in in the , , he has really really it . 
this year , we celebrate this 200 . <unk> <unk> <unk> on the search for the time time , " and his his analysis analysis analysis the the of the the and and the the , and my thing that we have hope hope . 
think think think think think , think , think about <unk> . right ? 
we think of the little boy that 's trying to sleep . 
we think of a a cake cake , in <unk> <unk> . 
we forget how the his vision was . 
we forget how <unk> it is . 
these kind of <unk> are are <unk> <unk> <unk> as <unk> as <unk> . 
i do n't know how <unk> is , but but we say , he 's . 
let 's look at the why the novel and the the that the the and and and so well . 
is it so obvious that that that , on the individual of of , , , , , such a a basis basis of a ? 
i do n't . i think it 's just hard to the the , because think think what happens when we 're <unk> . 
when we are <unk> , we 're a a . 
so , stories stories stories stories of the lives of other people and and they make it bad , because they 're so so that it 's us . 
as a <unk> of the history , and the audience we know what the detail has to to to the the knife into the the . right ? 
the way to make us all to us , and , and , and , and . 
in the first band , " in in the world , , , , the of the , , , and , and , and then , in the , , , they <unk> , and they and he and , " and wait , " i , i love
everything you give me and and me me joy , , , even someone else 's joy , even , even in this moment . " 
this is the story that he 's <unk> , and from there to <unk> to <unk> , that <unk> , every new , he he discovered in his his , his his his his his his his <unk> in his private <unk> . 
we 've been talking about <unk> and <unk> <unk> . 
<unk> friends friends leave the country leave the country if you want to to with with him . 
you do n't need to be <unk> to to find out that it 's hard work . right ? 
the 's is <unk> . 
it 's a <unk> - that 's going to be a . . 
what do the the ? 
it 's like information . 
i want to . 
the , the <unk> of brown hair and little little . . 
i want to get photos . 
so 's why it 's so successful . 
basically , the language of science and science and the . 
when <unk> <unk> these <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> on the <unk> , and the the of his his his his his , , he he this behavior . 
he says , " you may think that 's 's a , , but it 's not something else , to text a text text or text or a a . " 
he says , " there 's scientific scientific worth worth value . " 
what 's 's trying to show us is that is is is to look at us , but but in her core , , you know , for truth truth , the truth truth and the the : : the , the better , the better . 
in , , , , loss loss , that 's a <unk> way of wisdom in the wisdom . 
he says , " a woman that we need to suffer us , , us us , a us and a <unk> and more <unk> of the than a genius of a man who 's interested . " 
he tells us about about that we should make women women ? 
no . i think he 's us to say that he 's us to say something that tells us us . 
is there another different that that we us in this particular way ? 
<unk> - white - our our our our our our our our our our and and our our and our ? 
and we , we to see different different with with these kinds of different - <unk> ? 
freud should be <unk> <unk> . . 
one day was was a by a very young man who was who was the by the thought of his wife , that his wife was . 
and freud says , this man is kind of strange , because he does n't even know what his wife does . 
because she 's innocent , and everybody 's that . . 
the poor creature is lower under the . 
instead , he he looking for his his his his , without it , , so , behavior . 
<unk> them to she or she <unk> <unk> with a man ? 
[ freud ] says that the man is the the man 's wife of his wife . 
the novel is very good at this point . 
the novel describes very well , how much hard us us , , , but not not . 
because the more we are , the more we we us to . 
so i think that 's not that we should not make to or or or or things . 
i 'm to to be very . . 
and i think about about eight years , but i think also the story i 've been in the news news . 
a woman woman from michigan was written , she because she was designed by a self - <unk> <unk> , , <unk> news for himself . 
a whole year . 
they tried to get the new friend of her shoes shoes shoes , and i i to when i i the the , , i i with with . 
because ... let 's be honest . 
what if you do , , , , , is , right ? 
this is something a novel novel . 
this is something from a novel novel <unk> . 
<unk> is one of my favorite . . 
she 's the most <unk> and most woman woman american american . 
from her is " two - year - year - " and the <unk> mr. <unk> , , all <unk> act , the way of the , , and , and we 're in in the realm realm , the the in the the in the the what 's going
take a <unk> , , , your character character . 
first , tom <unk> tom , they got his and and have what they 've got , and she had what they had , and they they like , and by the , , and he on their name , he their their , their <unk> . 
this is a way . 
but what do we do ? we do n't make it as as tom . 
i ca n't give the the world world , even though i i to make it some days days . 
it 's a shame , because we live in a a time . 
we live in a " - time era . time . 
we are all good social social social media that are the the is is ? 
does the novel of the ? ? i 'm not sure . 
but we do what what do do when you 're not safe if you 're in a a . 
let 's go back to the street and ask questions to <unk> <unk> . 
think of think about think think about think about the , as a professor professor professor professor professor , this this great . . 
but i liked to <unk> <unk> , the boss of <unk> <unk> with the face of a rat , the <unk> needs , needs , the <unk> genius , it 's him to . 
that 's me familiar . 
so , needs needs his help , help him him and <unk> and the stories of stories stories . 
but when she came to start to start with something , and <unk> in " the six six " as a <unk> , and all with his <unk> <unk> , , and <unk> <unk> to <unk> and says , " we 're not <unk> on them , mr. <unk> .
we are proud proud . them . " 
and he said that there 's no <unk> to <unk> <unk> , , , , the <unk> , not n't want to to the the hand . 
that 's one of the few times that we can see <unk> in in the stories , and i find these little little very , , but , and , , 's true . 
it seems like that 's not an emotional , , but a problem . 
in a moment , it 's a <unk> on a different of of like like . 
and in the moment moment , they 're on a a . . 
<unk> <unk> <unk> it to to this this , he he he was he was . 
is it really easy ? 
what if you know , if if a really problem problem problem problem problem ? if it just about how we deal with the other relationship ? 
maybe we do n't think we 're n't going to be the . 
we we us to . . 
but i like <unk> . 
we we wait for that , we still have the literature as a as . 
literature alone , the the . 
literature alone , she can <unk> , , , and they them . 
and who 's all <unk> : the good news , the the tom tom , the <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> . 
we are in society society . 
thank you very much . 
i was about 10 years old and on a <unk> - old age with my father in a , , a a in the the of of the new york . 
it was a day day . 
the forest forest . 
the sun sun the the like like glass glass , and if if you do n't have a path , you you almost almost almost almost to that we 're going to get the first people who go through that forest . 
we came to our our . . 
i saw the little <unk> on a cliff , and i <unk> a a <unk> , <unk> , , , like something like something . . 
behind the roof , a a <unk> , maybe , four square , , with <unk> , <unk> <unk> , a <unk> . 
i was amazed , i was a and and confused . 
the were were were lazy to to , , what they had had were they were , who were they , they <unk> them to 
the question was asked me , and i asked them to them : 
who who are we going to 
how do you also or or where where " " might be , who are behind us behind us in istanbul ? 
who are a behind us behind rio in or or in paris ? 
this is in new york york <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 2000 2000 2000 2000 2000 2000 tons tons . 
i wanted to to them them as as as individuals . 
i wanted to understand who make the job . 
how is it it to wear a uniform and wear wearing wearing wearing wearing wearing wearing wearing wearing wearing ? 
so i started a with a . 
i drove the the the , , the and and and and and and and people in in and and and in the city city , and i was a lot of , but i still still a <unk> . 
i have to go deeper deeper . 
so i took a job job as a . . 
i did not just working with the truck . i was the the . 
and i was the the mechanical <unk> and and the snow snow snow snow . 
it was a remarkable privilege and and a a experience . 
everybody asks after the . . 
he 's there , but not as as as you think , and days days , which is really bad , you 're really right to be very quickly . 
you know , weight weight you you just hard . 
i know people who who had been doing this , several years , whose <unk> <unk> still still to the weight weight weight their weight to tons tons of tons of every week . 
and then there 's the danger . 
after the statistics of the , , the the in the the under the the of the jobs in the country , and i learned why . 
you 're all the entire day in traffic , all over the . 
everybody wants to and and and do n't want to be the . . 
this is really bad bad workers workers workers workers . 
and the <unk> itself is full of <unk> that <unk> from the <unk> <unk> and terrible . . 
i also learned the <unk> of the the of the . 
if you look from the <unk> , and from the <unk> of the city of a city city , you see that the is is a a self - . . 
he does n't stop to . 
it 's also like a kind of a or or a . . 
he has to be in movement . 
and then there 's the stigma . 
you put the uniform and and , and somebody until the reason you get the , because you 're the the or or or you 're going to close the the or to your your apartment , or you can your coffee in your your and and and you and
i think this particular particular particular particular because because i believe in the the the of the the the most important <unk> on the the of of the city . that 's three three . 
they are the most of the health health . 
if you do n't have the the , , , every day and efficient , and it 's <unk> out of the <unk> and and the and and the and and the <unk> , and to us very ways . 
diseases that 've been achieved for decades and decades , , they have spread and and us . 
the economy takes it . 
if we did n't take the old stuff , we did n't have a place of the new , the the motors of the the to start to the , and the is the is the . 
i do n't not know the capitalism , i just just the the . . 
and then that 's what i call our , , <unk> , <unk> speed . 
and i mean , just how fast we we are now movement . 
we 're not not about about our our our our our our or our our our , , or , or . 
we take them , throw them away , forget , because we know that there are people on the other side that are about <unk> . 
so i want to to today today some ways of how we think how to think thinking about how to think to improve the and and to build them to and and them them into those entertainment , create a city that are sustainable and and . 
your work , i think , is kind of <unk> . 
you see see the <unk> - day , , , , . 
they carry in many many of . . 
you can when you when you expect them . 
and your work are doing our our . 
they 're like a a . . 
the the that they they , , let us make sure ourselves before our our , our , , the , and and and we have to be more to to every price . 
after days after the , i 2001 , i took the <unk> of a <unk> on the <unk> , , and my son , son and ran the and and and there was a man who drove his <unk> , he he every . 
and i tried to him him his work , work on the day , day , days , but i started to cry . 
and he looked at me and and just looked and and said , " everything 's fine . " 
" everything is fine . " 
i started until until i started my my research and <unk> and met the the . 
his name is <unk> , and we worked together together ; we were we friends . 
i wanted to believe that <unk> had right . 
everything is fine . 
but in our our , , the way we we on this planet as a species , we 're also all the the cost of the , including including the very cost cost of work . 
and we have informed informed to help people to do the work , the the , , how we think about systems , which is a of of the last 40 years and the and the world , and to us to a a different species of mass that that
<unk> <unk> , we think think when we think about <unk> , , three percent of the national national national . . 
it 's a remarkable statistic . 
in your daily , in your lifetime , if you see the <unk> times , somebody 's see , whose job is to make them behind , they take a moment time you 're . 
take a moment to get to . 
hello , hi , what goes ?

i do n't like all of the homework , so so , , , all of all of my , , , getting in all all of these . . 
every time i i a a from the " the , , , my my teacher . 
but i never got a role . 
in my , my , my <unk> <unk> , a a <unk> project called " dance , " dance dance ,

i was a <unk> with . . 
so i i <unk> , , " finally , i want to get a role !

i said , " sorry , but if i ca n't , if you ca n't , the character ca n't . " 
i was born in <unk> , and they gave them a a without a . . 
college <unk> life life . 
hollywood is known known <unk> , <unk> <unk> , to to . 
after after i graduated , i was my role role as a <unk> in a . . 
my dream was true . 
and i knew that i was soon to get out of the " " " " " " 
but instead , i stayed a <unk> <unk> that was just the the the , and i realized realized that <unk> did n't have a , , , , , , , . 
they just only perfect perfect people . 
but , you know , the rule rule . 
i grew up with <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> , and all of these women had a common common : they were <unk> . 
so i became a . . 
my first job was to to <unk> <unk> new york city city new york city new york , and i 'm never going the the of the first <unk> that i ever stopped , forget him that he was the the the new jersey to new jersey with a with
i am in the in <unk> , in the united states , i 've also been the in the the east , , <unk> and <unk> . 
some people say , i 'm the first - in in the arab world . 
i do n't like to ask the first , but i 'm never that you 've never never heard of the little little that that women are not not , and they find us to . 
2003 , my brother brother from a mother and father , father , <unk> , and i was the new yorker new american american american <unk> that that now now have to be the . 
our goal was to to to the the negative image of americans from from to to the media and and and to the at the that that <unk> and and not not . . 
the the of <unk> was much much much much than the challenge challenge challenge against the stigma of disability . 
my my breakthrough breakthrough was 2010 . 
i was been to to the the in the <unk> " <unk> " " <unk> " . 
i was like to <unk> the <unk> , , , and she 'd me into a studio and and i sat on a chair chair . 
so i looked at the <unk> looked at and and said , " sorry , i i get a different chair ? " 
and she looked at me and and she said , " <unk> , four , four , two , two ... " 
and we were live ! live ! 
so i had to go on the table of the table , so i did n't take the scene out of the screen , and when the interview was finished , i was <unk> to . 
there was my opportunity , and i had her , , and i knew that i never never back . 
but mr. mr. <unk> did not me me me , but , but made me a a and and my my my chair . 
and working with the i 've been working with a i 've learned learned something like all the internet internet . 
people say , kids are cruel , but as a child or a child , or never never been me me . 
in the world wide web , i am with with my disability <unk> . 
when i look at online online , i see like like , " <unk> , why why why why why ? " 
" <unk> , is the <unk> ? " 
and my favorite : " <unk> <unk> . 
did it have ? 
we should be called them . " 
even even , , my disability into the <unk> , : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> . 
a disability is such as as . 
if a ca ca n't play play play , ca n't play play play . 
the are the the are the -- -- yes . that 's a worth value . 
people with the are the minority minority in the world , and we are the <unk> in the the . . 
the <unk> said , i never run , , i 'm sitting here here . 
but i i with social media , i i not n't here . 
i hope that we can make a a picture of disability in the media and and in the everyday . . 
maybe it 's n't seem to be less difficult at the internet when it more more positive . 
or maybe not . 
maybe it 's still a village to do a child . 
my journey journey has been me to me a very few places . 
i put on the red red next next to red <unk> and and the <unk> <unk> . . 
i i was working in a film with a <unk> and and with with my my , , with amazing , , . 
i 'm as a <unk> with the <unk> " <unk> <unk> - <unk> - . 
i was a <unk> of the <unk> new new york city in the national national center . 
i 've been a <unk> 's " <unk> , , a <unk> , who tries to give you a chance of a chance of the of my parents . 
but the one that moment that most most -- before before -- this -- the the , when i first the the the the how the a a and how a bee bee , the the has the way and the way that i do n't . 
this was the only time that my father ever ever seen a <unk> of of and i and i was going to talk to this presentation . 
: <unk> , god god your soul , your dad , dad . my name is <unk> <unk> , " " i can go , , " i can , " you can also that . " 
there was a time where we were <unk> problems . 
on the 21st , july , , , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from the the apollo apollo and and , and , and the , the the of the ocean . 
armstrong and <unk> were alone , but her her on the the of the , was the the of a a , , , ,

to to to the moon , nasa , , billion billion billion dollars billion dollars worth of , worth four percent of the . . 
apollo <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 400,000 400,000 and people and and and collaboration collaboration of and companies and <unk> . 
people died , including the of the apollo . 
but until the end of the end , 24 people people to the moon . 
from the <unk> , the his <unk> <unk> , is <unk> , after the last year , now the the . 
why did they go ? 
they did n't go much much more : : the more old , and something , which all the 24 <unk> <unk> a a new sense of that that our home is small and small . 
why did they go ? <unk> , they , because because <unk> kennedy wanted to show the wanted to show his his his his . 
but <unk> on words words on a university of the university of a . 
<unk> <unk> was n't just a single victory of the west eastern the east east of the cold war . 
at the time , the <unk> was a <unk> - <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of the technology of technology . 
it was a to the moon because it was something something . . 
the <unk> - a - a - a - long - century series of technological . . 
from the first century of the 20th century century , the the and the airplane , and and and a vaccine against a . 
the middle in the middle century polio and smallpox eradicated . 
technology seemed to to something about what 's called a <unk> <unk> a " <unk> . " 
<unk> , the human history of human history could n't even faster than a horse or a a boat with a , , but in the , the the apollo 10 10 miles per hour per hour . 
since 1970 1970 , no human have been on on the moon . 
no one has ever faster faster than the apollo of the apollo , and the optimism optimism of the power is the , but the problems problems that we 've had technology technology , to to clean clean clean to cancer , or the world the the of hunger ,
i remember remember as a <unk> , , i i as a 
the the of the apollo 17 , and my mother me me me , not too to the very <unk> <unk> . 
i had a idea that this was the last last <unk> , but i was sure that i was still alive in my life on mars . 
the <unk> <unk> " something happened with with our <unk> , with with with technology with technology technology , become a . 
you <unk> it . . 
we 've it in the last two days days at ted . 
it comes a front of us , as a psychological tells us and and ourselves with with with with , with with the and with things like the and and and social media and social media , or algorithms , the . 
it 's nothing wrong wrong with the of these things . 
they 've our our lives and and . 
but they do n't have the issues problems of humanity . 
what happened ? 
there 's a <unk> - from silicon silicon silicon silicon , where you 've been that in some time , have been more than than than in years years , intel , intel , apple apple apple and <unk> . 
in silicon valley , you 're the the <unk> , in particular , the special company , which are the company . 
silicon valley valley says that that turns out that way of gone from their ideas , to , , and and , problems problems problems problems problems problems . 
but this is not a good thing . 
it 's <unk> <unk> , which is silicon with silicon valley . 
even even their their times times small times small , tiny , , 10 years ago , a a 10 years 10 years . 
investors had always been using technology , technologies technologies technologies technologies technologies technologies like energy , which is a a carbon and and its development , and , never have never never never ever been the the development of of problems problems , have no value value . 
no , the <unk> of why we do n't have a problem problem of , - complicated - complicated - complicated - complicated - and - . 
sometimes we 're not going to not to the the problems . 
we fly to mars mars mars , we want to . 
nasa , even has a plan . 
but to mars , to make a political decision decision policy policy , and so it 's never going to happen to 
we 're not going to fly to mars because everybody thinks there are on the earth are things that are done . 
another time we do n't solve the problems problems problems because our political systems are fail . 
today , less than two percent of the earth 's energy , from sources , , wind , wind wind wind and wind , less than two percent , and the is the <unk> is is economically . 
coal and gas are solar than wind and wind wind and cheaper is cheaper than cheaper . 
we all want to alternative alternative , the <unk> - <unk> - , but it exist . 
now it 's so , , , and and and and all of all the the same opinion , the national of of the , the development of the , , , economic education , economic development , and development development and development and and and and and a price
but in the current political climate , there is no hope that the u.s. of the u.s. or or the international the international the these the and and and . 
sometimes are <unk> problems that are technically , , not not . 
it it 's been believed that that the the the the of the . 
but 30 years of research research taught taught that that political political political political impact have impact impact impact . 
technologies technologies technologies things like like like or or systems systems systems systems like systems and and and and , and , but it 's going to be a , , there are no governments . 
finally , eventually , sometimes , sometimes sometimes the sometimes the sometimes , because we do n't understand understand . 
<unk> - <unk> - war war war the war war , but you discovered discovered that there were many of of of the of of of of the resources are been therapy , and only only last years years , , , be be in the . 
difficult problems are difficult . 
it 's not true that we ca n't n't with with with technology with technology . 
we <unk> , we , we , we , we to to these four elements , the politicians politicians and the <unk> of interest , and , to be a problem , the institutions , the ; it must be a problem problem ; we understand it . 
the <unk> that led to to a a metaphor metaphor was technology to technology technology technology technology technology , technology to <unk> problems , , , and these criteria . 
but this is a model which ca n't happen in the future . 
it 's not the year . 
there 's no <unk> struggle like the cold war , no politicians like john 's , , everything makes all the and and and to to a a , , and no do n't have a <unk> like the the of the solar system . 
but in the , it was was just end to to moon moon . 
he was only three days . 
and it 's really that if it 's really a serious serious problem . 
we are ourselves ourselves ourselves and the future of the future will be be . 
god 's god , it 's not going to be a challenges . 
thank you very much . 
i 'll bring you to your eyes . 
imagine you , you front of your . . 
and the the the , , , color and the material material made it .

okay . now now 's the eyes . 
i 'm going you from a very competition competition competition competition every year , every year in new york city . 
he 's " <unk> - <unk> <unk> . " 
a few years ago , i wanted to to know about this as a <unk> as a <unk> and and the who who the the the of the . 
it was a bunch of new and some few of , and very different and and . 
they they look at look at hundreds of hundreds of hundreds of numbers numbers numbers numbers numbers numbers numbers numbers numbers numbers numbers numbers numbers numbers numbers numbers numbers numbers numbers numbers numbers . 
the learned that the names of of and and <unk> of the of of of of 
and it whole whole thing in just a few minutes . 
they were <unk> about who who the the of a a of a <unk> - <unk> . 
this is <unk> . 
these guys have <unk> <unk> <unk> . 
i i started to talk to some of them . 
this is ed , , a guy who was out of england and and there 's one of the <unk> <unk> . 
and i asked him , " ed , when did you notice you you have this particular ? " " 
and ed said , " i 'm not a <unk> . . 
i just have a average <unk> . 
everybody who 's going to , you , , or he 's just going to have a a . . 
we 've all all , we , techniques , , , , to these incredible techniques , , , which is the the two two years ago , and the techniques that used to to to to his to , and the the to of to to to <unk> <unk>
and i just , " wow , how does it have i 've never met it ? " 
we stood up <unk> front of the front and and , , wonderful wonderful , brilliant , and funny funny english says , me me , " josh , you 're a american journalist . 
you know , you ? " 
i said , " what ? ? ? ? " ? " ? " ? " 
" i like to teach my college to teach how to get a order of a <unk> - <unk> . . 
it 's the the the world that this is that everybody can . " 
i told him , " i 'm not not , but i , but you teach me me . 
i mean , you 've got to start somewhere somewhere , right ? " 
and that was the beginning of a very interesting journey , i me . 
so , a <unk> of the year - year - year - year - year - , i , i 'm to to it , and to understand it , understand how it works , why it does n't work and what his potential his own . . 
i have a lot of people interesting people . 
so here 's the example , for example , , for example , 
he 's suffering under <unk> , and he 's the worst worst worst of the world . 
his his is is so bad that he 's not going to be his his . . 
although though it was so tragic , he he in the way how much our our our our our we who we are . 
on the other side of the spectrum , i learned to to the the side of the spectrum . 
<unk> <unk> . 
he was the most <unk> <unk> <unk> in the movie film " film . " 
we spent a afternoon for the , in the , in lake city , to . 
and i came to to a a whole a , a <unk> , the <unk> , , , two years ago , and in the in the in the and and and in the in the . . 
and i 've got a whole bunch of interesting things . 
especially , especially , me that there was a time to convince the to to the the to to , to , , not nearly as much as the . 
there was a time when people were into the their , , , , it <unk> <unk> . 
so the last few decades , we 've a a series of technologies from the from the to the , , the , , the , , the computer , the the the it 's us us , and our our , , , that we human human human in
these technologies have our our modern world , but we at the same time . 
they 've made us <unk> and and and i and i argue that they have also have us have a . 
without the need to , , sometimes sometimes it as as we as we forget . 
one of the last places of the earth , you find still find people who still still are passionate passionate , and their , , , and , , and that is this unique . . 
<unk> is n't it unique , there are <unk> like this around the world . 
and this has me me the the the , i wanted to know how these guys do this . 
a few years ago , a university university at university university london london group of a brought into the lab . 
they wanted to know : is the structure or the of their brains differently than the rest rest rest rest of us ? 
the answer was : no . 
are you more than than we ? 
she gave them a a <unk> , and the answer was : actually did n't . 
there was a interesting interesting interesting and a interesting difference between the brain and a the a brain and a a a that was compared . 
if you put them into a a , and your brain , , you imagine , , and and images pictures pictures of you can see that the the regions of regions of regions of the than the rest of us . 
it seems like a <unk> part of the use of the use using the using the <unk> and and used to use it . 
why ? and we we learn from something ? 
the the to the the best part of a kind of a a , a year , every year , every one of the new technology to the to to the more more of more and and the rest of the rest . 
this is my friend ben <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> . 
on the table , front of him , 36 of the <unk> , he he he himself himself within an hour with an technology that he invented and and as a . 
he used a technique technique technique to show the the order of of four - <unk> <unk> in half an hour . 
yes . yes . 
and even though it 's a a of techniques techniques techniques to put things together in these <unk> <unk> , , but they all created the techniques on the concept that psychologists called <unk> <unk> . 
this so so - <unk> to this concept , this is : what follows follows : : if i look at two to the the same word , and you say , " you you , " you know , there 's a person called <unk> . " 
this is his name . 
and i say , " " you know that there 's one person who 's a <unk> . " 
now , when i 'm to to a moment at you now you and you say , " you you you the word that i 've ever met you before you before some time ago ? 
you you got it word " " " was it ? " 
the person person who person person person who person , , remembers with to think of the word that the person person who person the person person who person the person . 
same word , things <unk> , ; it 's strange . 
what 's going on here ? 
well , the name is <unk> means . 
he 's absolutely <unk> of all the <unk> that that in in in your head . 
but the profession of the , we know we 're <unk> . 
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . . 
<unk> have have a on their <unk> . 
<unk> smell are good at home home from home . 
maybe we even know a <unk> . . 
and when we first the word first , we , we we this this with the word , the word , and it it , which <unk> the <unk> . 
the secret thing going on in the front of the , , and to to to to find things better , to to the the of the , into the , , , , no matter , no sense , meaning in meaning , in a sense sense sense ,
one of the most techniques techniques can can two two years 500 years of the the . 
she was known as the known . . 
the story of his story is : : there was a poet called <unk> who who a a <unk> . . 
he was the the conversation , because , when when if you wanted to really a really <unk> party party , , you did n't want a <unk> , , but a poet . 
he <unk> his poem from the <unk> front of the front and and the the the room , and the the moment the the behind behind and and all all together . 
not only are all dead , their <unk> are are are to to to <unk> . 
nobody one can tell anyone who was , nobody nobody who who has . 
the <unk> did n't get properly . 
it 's a <unk> after after the other . 
<unk> <unk> , the the <unk> <unk> of this disaster , he 's his his eyes and <unk> he he he he he can see his front eye , where where where where where where where where . 
and so he picks the the the the hand and hand it through the the the . 
now , moment , moment , something that we all know that we do n't matter how bad we we , , , , , , , , , our colleagues , we have a very good and and <unk> . 
i 'm going to ask you to first the first 10 words of the history of the , , , so hard to find it hard . 
but i bet if i ask you to ask yourself who remember standing in this moment on a horse horse horse , horse in your , horse , your body , the <unk> . 
the idea of the is is to be a full - eye eye and and it with with the the of things things to <unk> <unk> , the <unk> , , <unk> , , , , , , , , , , , , , , the <unk> of the
this is a advice that on the two - year - old - old - old - the - <unk> - . 
so how does it work ? 
you you 're invited to to at ted , ted and you you it out of the , , as it did , it <unk> , he <unk> <unk> <unk> . 
you 're just way to think you you you your your front of your front . 
imagine a a secret story and and story story with a pictures of , and remind you that you first first to first first to this first <unk> to to this whole <unk> . 
and then you put in your house and you see the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of of mr. <unk> . 
and the remind you remember your friend ed ed . 
and when you look at the time , you you you to a a a that you you to . 
you put into your <unk> , and the fourth thing , you you to to the was that you 've been to a year , and you 've got some friends who you help you remember you remember you remember . 
so , <unk> <unk> did n't <unk> their <unk> , word word word word word , word confused , , , but subject , subject . 
the english term " <unk> <unk> , " a theme theme of , comes from the greek word " " " " " " . " 
these are <unk> of those people that people people the <unk> and and and and and in in terms of . 
the the " " " " " " " " " " first " first . " 
i i was just this , and i 'm still , and and and i 'm still 
some of the other 's risks . 
i wanted to maybe something something <unk> <unk> <unk> this <unk> of <unk> . 
but there was a problem . 
the problem that the are the are are are are . . 
it 's like a group of people who sit sitting there , and write a test . 
it 's already exciting if somebody 's <unk> . 
i 'm journalist journalist , i need something to write something worth . 
i i that the the things that things are in the the of these people , , but i do n't have access to it . 
so when i wanted to tell this story , i had to to to position . 
and so i began to every morning every 20 minutes 20 minutes before i started with my newspaper , i was something something about something . 
maybe a poem or or maybe a poem or or a poem . 
the name from a old <unk> that i bought on the <unk> . 
i had to realize that it was much much more powerful . 
i could never imagine . 
it has made it <unk> , because it 's not about to train the train . 
you 're always better better better better better , and these these , , , , , , , , , , and hopefully , images images to your your eye . 
i 'm at it . 
here 's me with my <unk> . . 
a couple of <unk> and a <unk> that that were up to two little of of , because the enemy is the enemy enemy . 
i went to the same same i i had a year year year . 
and i 'm going to , , just as a experiment experiment . 
it 's a nice <unk> <unk> my my . 
the problem was that the experiment did n't like like . . 
i won the <unk> , which is really not supposed to happen . 
it was nice to to to <unk> and and and and , and that was n't what i wanted to do . 
that 's just tricks . 
and the work work because they work on some simple ideas ideas the the of our our . 
you do n't build to build a - or - or - to - to - to - to - to - to - to - to - to - to - to - to - to - to - to - . 
we often often talk about people with people who are , as a a , , but a a special , but that 's not true . 
good good are are <unk> . 
we 're going to better things when we look . 
we remember , if we 're getting . . 
we remember , if we have the the to figure out why why information and and experiences are <unk> , why they have meaning , and when we put into into something that is <unk> to us into our other senses , and we call the name " " "
the <unk> , , these <unk> , they 're all just <unk> . 
<unk> , it 's not not real real . . 
they work because they work us to work . 
they 're us to be and and , , in a way that we 're not usually . 
but it 's not a <unk> . 
that 's how things things are going to be in the . 
one thing i i do you you you to the way that i was through , i did n't know , who did n't remember his man who are n't , , and our lives are the lives of our memories . 
how much are we willing to lose our our lives , our our our our , , instead of telling us us to how we are we losing , because we are so lazy that we are n't <unk> <unk> and and ? 
i learned that the <unk> , , in of us , incredible incredible . . 
if we want to live a life , , we we the person who do n't know to . 
thank you . 
in the 27 , , i , i a a job job in the <unk> <unk> , a a . 
in <unk> schools in new york , i i i <unk> <unk> <unk> . . 
as any teacher teacher , i i , i tests tests and 
i was homework homework . 
when the work work , i , i i grades notes . 
in the , the only difference between the best and worst worst . 
the 's a few of my <unk> of <unk> <unk> were not <unk> . 
some of my favorite kids do n't get very well . 
and that 's me me . 
what you do in the . in the , in math , is difficult to get the numbers , <unk> numbers , <unk> , the <unk> of a <unk> . 
but <unk> are not these concepts . i was found that i found that that all of my favorite , that my my my learning learning the learning of learning , , and they were working and and and hard . 
after some years , i came to the conclusion , we we that we need a lot of better social learning and learning learning from learning from a perspective of motivation , from a psychological perspective . 
what we do in the is is is the best measure of the . but what if if in the and and life , , much of more more than more quickly and and and learn ? 
so i i the classroom , and a a to to . . 
i started kids kids and adults in all all , all , , , always always , who i am , and why ? 
my my , and i went to the west institute . 
we were trying to what what the <unk> the the the the wrong and the ones and not . 
we went to national national national national and and and , the children that the the the . 
we studied <unk> that worked in in very tough business , and asked them to teachers teachers the the the the of the , and and and and and the them of their their - improve the most better . 
we went partnerships with the and and , and what who their their their , they were their to their their . 
and who 's make the money . 
in all these different ways , the evidence of an individual and and is . 
it was not social intelligence . 
it was n't good good , , health health , and it was n't . 
it was <unk> . 
<unk> is is passion and common and very long term term term . 
<unk> is <unk> . 
<unk> is is when you 're a a a a , , not just a week or a month , but a a years , but a really hard to work to plan . 
<unk> is is like a marathon , not <unk> . 
i was started in in in schools in schools in chicago . 
i asked thousands of thousands of the the the <unk> <unk> <unk> , the the <unk> , and then i and then i a year year to see who was made of the . 
it turns out that children with <unk> <unk> are hard to have the , even even if i all all the properties properties , things like things , , , as if you get tests tests , even as you get it in school . 
so , <unk> <unk> did not just in in the and and and , but also in school , especially children children with <unk> . 
the the <unk> about this topic is that that we know so little that that science science so little as little as as it . 
every day , my parents parents and teacher teacher , " how do we children the children of children ? " 
how did i teach a a look at ? 
how do i like you <unk> it 's ? ? " 
the answer answer : i do n't touch it . 
what i 'm going to do is not just you you 're not going to have a . 
our data show that that a lot of of people are not not going to remain to . 
<unk> is <unk> <unk> not not our our <unk> <unk> , not , but even , with talent . 
so far , the best idea that i 've been able to have the of of the of of , is called the <unk> . . 
this idea was at stanford stanford university of stanford and and and the the that the the the to learn not learn to not not to be able to do it with her her . 
dr. <unk> showed that kids when they read read the brain read the brain and learn how it 's to answer to challenges and challenges and and , , , much more likely to do , much , because it 's not a failure condition . 
this this is is is a great idea of the the idea of <unk> . 
but we need more . 
i 'm going to finish my my , , we 've been so far . 
that 's the work that 's us . 
we we our best best best ideas and and <unk> and and test . 
we measure measuring , whether we succeeded successful , we were ready to be willing to have to , to have to to learn lessons and from from to to . . 
in other words , we need to to to give our kids more . 
thank you very much . 
in the center of my work is the connection of <unk> to our and and part of the environment , architecture architecture architecture from the local , local local , , traditions traditions traditions traditions traditions traditions . 
today , i 've been as example example , projects projects projects projects . 
both of projects are in , , in one of and and one in tunisia . 
they also have common that the different different different different different perspectives are different part of the brain to become a part of the . . 
the first example started with a invitation , a <unk> - in - based in in capital capital capital capital . 
this is the kind of <unk> that that us us , my team and and , to me as an example of what we should should be shown . 
first first i thought i wanted wanted to to . 
after we 've seen a couple of these these , , there there are many of of the city in the city that we found that they have three three . 
first , these are the <unk> - empty , because they 're very high - - , where people do n't afford to buy things . 
second , they need a lot of energy because because the glass are glass from the glass , which is inside inside inside , and then you need lots of <unk> . 
in a city , not should n't happen to , because they have pretty weather that that 's been 25 to 20 to 25 25 . 
and thirdly , you have their their with with with and and and . 
this is a place in a place called a rich culture and tradition . 
i was , , i first , the first - old - old old - old market with this old market with where the people and people , and and , and , , and small , small . 
it has also this idea of space space that uses the <unk> to create the . . 
so i thought , that 's exactly what i really want to design , not a a . . 
but the question was , how we we a a , , , - with with with these principles . 
the challenge challenge challenge when we were to the the , , because it 's in a a city town of the city , most of the most of you you were sitting there , the there , not there . 
it 's between two two two , two - two - , - half - of - have have no have . 
first first , we created a connection between these two <unk> , and i put all the the of the the . 
the is a a - a - that that that a a that is a a in in the <unk> that itself itself itself its own shape itself and its sun . 
and to get this <unk> , we we the idea of a with a little with that little that that in every each , because of because of the form of the , , . 
i also also , how do we get the <unk> ? 
i wanted to really find a a that that to the local local . . 
i started started <unk> <unk> like a a a out of concrete out of concrete with <unk> that which the air air , and light light , but in the form form . 
and then this this , this <unk> <unk> of the the . 
they have the properties of a a geometry , and that helped me to the entire entire . . 
we 're building this with little little little , , the windows that air air and light in the way into the way into the way . 
and that 's being through these little , , <unk> <unk> that that the light light from the the to to to the the at the night . 
it was n't simply simply the the to with these ideas , because they thought , " this is not a not - shaped . that did n't have . " 
but then we realized that we this idea that the idea of the is a much more than the idea of a <unk> , because they basically sell more sell more sell more . 
the concept of the was was much , much , much , , not just because of the material compared , but glass , but because because we had n't have a conditioning . 
so we created some <unk> - that we used to to project . 
the first first was to think , we think , how to make the <unk> <unk> , , a city city , which city , which city has almost almost <unk> . 
we created a call the , by by on the roof on the roof . 
and under this this , , we put this roof as a new space space with space and with and and , and that that this this this . 
these these are the roof roof on the roof , the water to the the . 
hopefully , at the beginning of the year , we have the the to 5 . 
the second example is a a - <unk> - 2000 - based 2000 in the and and in in . 
so , to project , project project project project project project project project that i 've ever been , , i had to understand the city of the city , but also the environment , the tradition , the tradition and the culture . 
and this analysis analysis analysis i i particular particular on the the , , which is the 1,000 - old structure that was from a wall , through 12 , , , and by by the way to the . 
when i was to the , , the first step to to the the first to create the first 12 of , with with <unk> and and and like like the in and and in other <unk> <unk> with these <unk> . 
and we <unk> a a bunch of the points points into the into the the of of these , and and they with with straight lines , and the <unk> pattern pattern . 
the final step was , to step the the cell cell , the small cell of the project , as the as , as a a part of the . . 
what does the best best in in a a - - - - - a - a - ? 
this is <unk> , because of the <unk> between the between the between the two <unk> that created created created and created a <unk> . . 
so we put a pattern pattern , the the that that most of the most that are are in in this direction . 
and that 's the result , it 's almost like a combination of a <unk> and and the arab city . 
there 's the <unk> with the and and in the , , and these whole whole of of . 
it also also the the the that that density density density density density in the upper and and a a density density in the . . 
it also also the concept of the . 
the volume has this shape form that has evolved through three different of of , , and also , very dense light to light , in the the , , three different of , , a a and a kindergarten and and a a series of <unk> , the <unk>
the roof , my <unk> project on this project , the community 's almost the the space of the building to build the . 
there 's all <unk> neighbors and all together and and and things , make things like a a a , and a morning , a a <unk> , to the <unk> . 
these two examples have made a common approach of the . 
they 're in <unk> where you can see the growing growing growing . 
in these <unk> , , the effects of architecture in architecture in the today and and lives of people people the local communities and and as as as as as as the . grow . 
and that reason , it 's important to architecture that architecture , but but <unk> <unk> , that that the the relationship between the community and the environment , and the on , and to connect . 
thank you very much . 
i 'm <unk> <unk> , and i and i 'm them to the the the most important opinions . 
they 're so so that they become become the . . 
there is one of my view . 
<unk> one claim : trust is trust in the , , many . 
then we need to trust more confidence . 
and a task : we should build the confidence . 
i think the claim the the goal and the challenge to the wrong ideas . 
i 'm going to give you a different story of a a , a goal and a a and a a a a better approach to the the . 
first of the claim : why do people think trust is trust ? 
and when i really talk to my current knowledge , i know know , i do n't know the answer . 
maybe it has some some some or or or in some cases , or in other . . 
i 'm not going to the the . 
but i can look at the the of the that that are the the source of the faith faith faith , the faith is the . 
look at a look at a video - , , , a lot of of - <unk> . 
and will be people people who were 20 years ago , journalists journalists and and , and still still . 
and the people who was very very , very , , , still very , : : , , , nurses . 
we 're other in the . , and the average average almost is almost in the middle . 
but is that a good proof ? 
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . 
what what they do ? 
so you look at the general people of people people when you 're going to be certain questions . 
trust trust politicians ? trust trust ? 
now , if you ask somebody asked , trust trust , you trust ? 
trust trust it 's ? 
trust trust it 's ? 
and then you would ask you , " " " " right ? " 
and the <unk> is a a response . 
and if you answer the answer to you , you might say , " i 'm not some of you , but not . " 
rational rational . 
in short , we 're in in short short , we 're trust in different ways . 
we do n't think of it that we every every or a a in in a or or a . 
so i i say about saying that i 'm given a particular , i 'm a , , first grade , the first class , i , i , but i do n't want to drive the . . 
maybe i i <unk> that that they 're not doing good car . 
i was that my my friend friend a a a a <unk> running on the running , , but maybe they were n't paying to secret a secret secret . 
simple . 
so know how we know from our everyday ways , how different can look , but why do we know this knowledge if we 're thinking about climate - ? 
the the situation in the very very , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> , , because they the the sense of the the sense of the . 
second , , we get to . 
the goal is to trust more confidence . 
honestly , i think that 's the stupid . 
i do n't stop that . . 
i 'm trying to try to trust the more confidence , but not n't . 
i 'm actually actively on the to not trust . 
and those who have to give their their to the the of of a certain event , which is like the the , , , the <unk> , " " " " " i i think , " i think , too much . 
" trust trust , is no <unk> goal in this life . 
trust and be and be to be the goal . 
and then you say , yes , okay , what 's most important to do is not trust , but <unk> . 
the <unk> people from <unk> to <unk> . 
and to do that , we look at three things : we look at things things things . 
are you ? ? are you honest ? are you <unk> ? ? 
if we can a person person in the , topics , and , and we , we have a good reason to trust , it 's 's <unk> . 
but the person 's probably not , , probably not . 
some of my friends are and and , and i , i would n't make them letter letter , because they are <unk> . 
i have friends friends that are very much their own their , but they are <unk> it . 
and i 'm very happy glad that i did n't have a friends that are and and and , but but are . . 
if you have , i did n't even have it . 
but after that , we look at , , , , trust . 
trust is the response . 
the <unk> is <unk> <unk> . we 's a hard . . 
we 've been working the last decades of decades , we 've been able to address the full - all - and institutions and experts and experts and make it easier to make their <unk> . 
many of these systems have the effect effect . 
they do n't work like . . 
a <unk> said once said to me , " the problem is that the the computer - free takes the when the baby to to the the world . " 
in our our daily daily daily , our our , our our , , this problem problem , and this this and and and and , and , , but to make the opposite . 
it 's people people like people 's their their tasks tasks by taking their <unk> . . 
i can , can can any any of . 
so so 's what 's going to . 
the goal is more more , and that 's difficult to be if we want to be more and and and and other other other , , and if we 're <unk> <unk> , whether people people , or or or or , , politicians , 
it 's not easy . you have to be it it . simple reactions , or does n't n't . 
and now to do the task . 
this as a as of the describe describe , the the . 
because it suggests that they should and trust trust . 
we do the the - - - ourselves ourselves . 
we we a a little bit of a . 
so two two people two people to improve the . . 
but ultimately , it 's a by being that by being done by one . 
you ca n't do that again what else do . 
you have to give you a serious that you trust . 
so you have to be <unk> . 
that 's because the 's that you do n't usually all the people at the nose . 
but they also get older that they are <unk> . 
how does that ? ? 
it 's happening every day , <unk> , normal people do do , , , , , , , effective . 
here 's a simple example example . 
the store where i put my socks , , they me me and ask them ask . 
they take them and give me the money money , or , or some of the in the in the . 
this is great . i 'll show you you you 've shown shown to me . 
there 's a morality of morality . 
you you think of the as as a as a , , it 's a very good good that you 're <unk> , and you you to to your own words . 
so our goal is not very difficult to recognize . 
it 's relationships between people people , and the <unk> , and when the other is is . 
so the morality of history is so much much more trust or or or faith , or faith , the , or by <unk> or or <unk> , , and much more more more and more and more and and how you you people people , and , and ,
thank you . 
you know , the best thing i 'm most most are are the films i i can . 
i love my own my with my my my kids , and when my daughter was four years old , we 've together together , " the " of " . " 
the film has n't left it . 
her <unk> was was <unk> . . 
so she had a good excuse to wear a <unk> dress , and a a <unk> . . 
but if you look at this film often , you you see what it 's actually is . 
we live in the today in our era and and our children in a kind of a - - <unk> - . 
but " the was was by by . . 
he did n't have this trend . 
it has 40 years , and this with a , with a interestingly , a a a different a , a guy , and a guy with a a with a a a a , and they the the the the of the . 
you know , i know what i 'm talking about , right ? 
right . 
well , there 's a a difference between between these two films , even multiple differences differences between the ' of of " and and and the the movies that we are today today . 
<unk> once once , in the ' " of " very " violence . 
the monkeys are pretty aggressive , as as the <unk> . 
but i think if the had inspired by by <unk> , today , by <unk> <unk> , who said the <unk> said , " <unk> , you know , you 're the <unk> of that that we 've been . 
use your your shoes to to the computers of computers , the <unk> of of the west . " 
but it does n't happen . 
another point i 'm at the " " of " " " is unique unique , is that the <unk> and and and and and even more characters characters characters . 
this is the first time when i was my daughter , star star , " i was , what was was was , and was was different . 
at that time , i had a son . 
he was at the time time three years old . 
he was n't invited to this that he was n't too young . 
but he was the second child , and he was less less than his sister . 
so he 's a , , and he 's the the film , he 's a a his mother , and , and i do n't think he 's going to what he was going on , but he 's it it 's in in . 
and i wondered what he was doing . 
did he <unk> it courage courage , correct and and ? 
does he <unk> that that a army army a army army to get the government ? 
he 's that there 's only in the in the universe , and <unk> and these these who who really cool , but , but most of the time , the a with a a and a <unk> to to the the the the the universe , which he was
compare this with " the of of " " " . 
how does your <unk> your your to to a good end ? 
by with all the and and a . 
this is the kind of world i i my kids my kids rather <unk> <unk> , , , or , and , and in in the world , in the world , , which is to to , which is so much of our world today . 
why is there so much more <unk> <unk> , power , in the movies that are children children our children , and so few so <unk> ? 
there 's a lot of good literature to the the the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> boys boys at the <unk> , and they should read it . it 's very good . 
but i did n't have read much of how guys with this this . 
i 'm out of a experience that that that <unk> <unk> did n't use the <unk> model model that i use using to use to to find the through the world of adults , in the <unk> and and and common common . 
i think there was this moment with the first kiss , when i really expect that the <unk> <unk> was , , because that ends ends up or right ? 
i 've my mission , i 've the the the . . 
why do you see there ? 
i do n't want what to do . 
the movies are very very to to the the the and and its its heart , and there 's not a lot of other relationships other relationships and other . 
it does almost like as a young animal is a animal animal and if you 're a <unk> , you should better better your . 
there are are exceptions exceptions , and i 'm going to be the the of of of any of you . 
but they give give a message to the young to the boys that are not not the . 
they 're real to teach the teaching how they they to the the - term - term , , but they 're not necessarily the the to do the they 're going to to the . 
there 's no way of them . . 
there are also some women who are new stories , stories , stories , and our business and and and and and and are also , and they 're still <unk> . 
and the most common of of all the time is ever a classic after the other , and every single one of you is a a , or a man , or two of two , who are friends , and son son and son , or two two ,
until the , of many of you , you think of this year , when they <unk> the movie " the <unk> " the <unk> " the <unk> . " 
i recommend him all of him . he 's on the internet . 
do you remember what the critic said , " " <unk> " ? 
" oh , " i ca n't believe that has made a a . . " 
it 's very good . let 's not get it that . 
but as no one of these movies has the the the . . 
i do n't have if you 've had to have it . 
it 's not yet not to have that right , and to be , , but maybe we 're going to start today today . 
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> and and in the middle of the the this , that she with with a friend of the films films that had seen seen . 
it 's very simple . there 's only three questions you need to ask : there there 's more than a character in the film , which is the and and something ? 
try try to get that . . 
and talk about women women in the time of the ? 
and what 's in their entertainment is something else than the the guy they they both two ? 
it ? <unk> . 
thank you very much . 
two women who exist exist and other , including anything . 
this is what happens . i saw it , and yet i see it it 's the the movies that we know and and . 
so , i i went to this week to see me a very good movie , " <unk> . " 
you remember ? a lot of the in the <unk> , <unk> <unk> , a general general <unk> , which is a good - . 
he <unk> with with <unk> through the the . . 
i think that should n't n't , because because a <unk> of the the i did n't see if they saw him but but a a a of the in in a message , the the <unk> and women women and the <unk> of the . 
there are some good scenes in which <unk> in in this deep deep , by <unk> <unk> and the <unk> moment , one of the <unk> , has gone through a <unk> and and say , " you you go to bed , " ? ? " 
this is some some of hollywood . 
so let 's look at look at the numbers . 
in 2011 2011 , under the 100 of , , what do you think how many of these had were <unk> <unk> ? 
11 . that 's not <unk> . 
it 's not so many of the number of number of women who we just have have congress in congress , so that 's the good . 
but there 's a number that 's more than than this is and this is the this space . 
last year , the new york times a a study that has government government . 
you you that you 're saying that you 're saying that 
one of of women women in the united states that they 've been to to their life . 
i do n't think that 's the fault of . 
i do n't think that have to do anything . 
i do n't think that that and and and right to do something with something , but a little bit of , and when i 'm this statistics , , one of the things i think think that are many of . 
who are these guys ? what are they doing ? 
what do you do n't learn to learn ? 
take your story , that it 's the task of a <unk> , , the the violence violence violence violence and then then the the , what the woman woman who does n't have friends and not talking about it ? 
so let 's take this story ? 
you know , as a parent that has privilege privilege , a daughter , , just like the same thing that we do , we 're this world and and these statistics in and we want to to them . 
we have a to to the like " <unk> , and we hope hoping that will help , but i 'm also going to ask whether whether 's going to be , if we , at the same time , active or , , , , , our , ,
the <unk> is a means that we 're doing something very important , and i 'm 'm talking to to the the . . 
i think we 're just <unk> our our simple - a - definition definition of <unk> . . 
the definition of <unk> is already to to . . 
they 've read how the new york of the roles of the and <unk> . . 
they 're going to mess . . 
our our will find a way to adapt to to a new relationship , and i think we really show you that a is someone who 's his his sisters and and on your side side , and the really are the guys guys who are are women . 
i think we should be looking for the <unk> to find the the , when we find them find the search that are there , the real the human beings , and people and and and to to with these these and and say , " i 'm on on
when i was my daughter , who who her <unk> in " star wars , " " you know what you said ? 
<unk> . 
<unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> . 
what what have these two common together ? 
maybe it 's not just the most dress . 
i think these two figures are experts experts . 
these are the two characters in the film that know more than everybody else and and their knowledge to to other people to help them help their own full of . 
they 're <unk> <unk> . they 're <unk> . 
i 'm this kind of commitment , my daughter , my daughter , and i this this kind of task my job . 
i 'm more more tasks tasks like this . 
i 'm less tasks tasks in my son , " and " and and " and , and and tasks , to to a team , maybe a team that will be to a to help people better better , better better people , the the of the . 
thank you very much . 
i 'm talking to you with a story of a a . . 
i do n't know what i do n't , but but his story . 
he lives in a small village in the . village . 
his village is in the <unk> of <unk> . 
the most successful death of poverty and and the <unk> . . 
and when there was nothing there was him , he he his village , he walked his town , in in this case , <unk> , the capital . 
when he 's there , there 's no no , , no jobs , no way . 
at the end , he 's in a a <unk> of of <unk> . . 
it may not a a year , but nothing . 
one day , he will be a by a man who wants him to lunch lunch to dinner , dinner for dinner . 
he 's this this dynamic group of young people and they give him an opportunity . 
he gets a little money to buy new clothes clothes and to to home and home . 
it 's going to be this young woman . 
<unk> <unk> . he . . 
he starts to new a new life . 
his life has a sense . 
on a day day , day , , <unk> , , walk into a straight . 
this <unk> <unk> with the was was the <unk> and and and and group of young people had been <unk> to have a a with a with with . 
how could the story of a <unk> - just just trying to to to the the to the that he himself himself in the air ? 
he had . . 
he had an opportunity to focus on the future , and a it , the was the first opportunity to him him . 
it was the first thing to him him from a state that we call " <unk> . " 
and his story is again over again over the areas of the around the world . 
it 's the story of the , , , , , youth , who are in and and london and and and something something something something . 
young people are moving from from the city , from their <unk> , , , , , , , but young people do n't have to share the wealth of their . . 
it 's often the the that are under the . 
2030 2030 , three three - year - old - in the the the 18 18 years as 18 years . 
if we do n't young people in the growth of the , if we do n't give them a , , they 're " , " the the in in the in the violence in violence and violence in the . 
in my <unk> , , , , , , 70 percent of the young people are unemployment . 
70 percent do n't have work , do n't go to school . 
they do n't actually do anything . 
last month , i went back after <unk> , and i went to the <unk> , the hospital where i was born . 
i remember , i was this this hospital , and i asked what what if if i never get from here ? 
what if i had to the same condition of " " forced forced forced ? 
i i got to ? 
i 'm not sure what i 'm going to do . 
the reason the <unk> was was was was was was in in the was actually the the of of a young - old boy and entrepreneurs . 
i was about 90 young <unk> of <unk> . 
we went together and we started a a to a <unk> <unk> of the of of of the city . 
in the room , a young man , <unk> . 
he went the the <unk> in the <unk> and and his his . . 
there was no job and no <unk> . 
i remember remember , he told me that had a <unk> , , and frustrated was the perfect goal goal , member member , and to be and and other . 
they 're people people . 
but this story takes another different . 
in <unk> , the are are obstacles are to to from a to to to the the . . 
23 23 years , the <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> that that that the the best best is best . 
and <unk> , the opportunity and and they . 
he 's a a . . 
he started to <unk> <unk> on <unk> , who could n't afford to afford . 
with his family and his friends , he bought he 10 10 <unk> and he he <unk> , , he was <unk> his <unk> in the the three years . 
how do you tell this story from the other ? 
what what makes the difference ? 
i think it 's a <unk> to to a new opportunity . 
it 's the <unk> , and i think that the can be the means to be the means " 
it 's the young people who to the the opportunity to create the that they 're desperately . 
you can teach people people to be entrepreneurs . 
i i with with you a young guy who was talking to one of my meetings , a <unk> : a <unk> . 
he helped me to give the the of some young people who are at the summit , and to show them how to build innovative and and . 
he 's <unk> the first <unk> , who has been <unk> <unk> , since until before before before before before before there was a <unk> , that they <unk> <unk> , that they had the from the ship from the from the , , when you wanted to to the
when you ask somebody , " when did you last time you last time you ? " " the answer was many of the the of the <unk> of the <unk> : " never " . " 
so saw saw an opportunity . 
he 's a a with a with a . . 
he put a a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and and and started <unk> and <unk> <unk> , which he said , in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . 
he started to talk to flowers with <unk> , , private private and and and around the town and he was working working on the the of the first - year - in the in the last . 
there 's no parks parks in in <unk> . 
he 's a place place where people and young people are and together and he said , he he the the <unk> things of the <unk> . 
just 's the the , it does n't have a because because they too much to water . 
so the first step is to bring young people to , , in in this room , <unk> has been <unk> <unk> to the other people in the room . 
they never had really thought of thinking , a a a . . 
they thought they had a a a work , or a government government , but but that story , his , , innovation , a strong impact on . . 
he <unk> them to look at her city as a place of the . 
he <unk> them that they 're entrepreneurs to find the <unk> they 're the the . 
at the end of the day , they had innovative <unk> <unk> some some of the most challenges challenges of their city . 
they had had the local local local problems . 
the inspiration of young people , and the the of a a is a really , , but but people people people to to their their ideas . 
they need <unk> and and to to to develop them to develop their develop and develop . 
they 're people people with the resources that they need , they give them , give them the the they they to to to ideas ideas , and they 'll make <unk> <unk> - growth growth . 
<unk> me me , more than me a more than just a <unk> of . 
it 's about social social . . 
<unk> - sold sell not just flowers . 
i think he sold hope . 
his design is <unk> , " when he created created the way of people people to the city . 
<unk> <unk> has <unk> <unk> to help him to the the <unk> and <unk> . 
he gave them the chance to the the <unk> state of the " " . " 
these young companies have a tremendous impact on their <unk> . 
so my suggestion is , you you to young people to , , and and and them their their innovations innovations , and they 're more more and more and and and " " " " " and " " " " " 
thank you very much . 
my childhood childhood in my was was one of my favorite favorite , to to to to to the of of of , because my parents , the the . 
but these are are hard to find . 
they 're from sand sand , barely barely . 
but after a certain period , i had a a . 
i began to see , , patterns patterns , who helped me , they they . 
and it was to to to find a passion , to find a love - and and the the . 
and when i started studying studying , i realized that i see that my eyes would not see my eyes . 
because <unk> grew up in my my beach in a car , a a long , , along the <unk> , and my <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of <unk> . . 
the me to me me to use . 
i had to see differently to see the past in a map . 
so i want to show you how we example to we differently , if we use use . . 
this is a <unk> - which is called <unk> <unk> <unk> called <unk> <unk> . 
and the <unk> - <unk> - brown , , we use , but we 're , and , it 's with color , and this is this is this is called <unk> . 
what you see here here are the chemical chemical of the landscape through the and and and the of the old . . 
what i 'm going to share with you today is how we used to have to to a a a city that which the the name of the <unk> and and thousands of years of thousands of years . 
<unk> was the capital of the old - old , , more than years years , a a a <unk> , rich , , about about years ago . 
the <unk> is in the <unk> , and it 's very efficient , because it 's in the rich realm of the - renaissance - art art , architecture and religion and religion . 
and , knew that the <unk> of of the would be in the the of the the of the , , the two two the two , , the the red , , but in this massive . . 
this area is huge , , the <unk> <unk> four times four times . 
<unk> <unk> at the <unk> directly directly to the <unk> , and , and <unk> , and <unk> towards the west , and he 's the city . 
so how do you find a city city in a a . . 
they find find find find find the <unk> to find the to find the needle in the , , with with eyes and <unk> . 
so we used to <unk> - to - map map a map of the landscape to see a <unk> <unk> . 
where the the of the <unk> <unk> . 
but you see , , and this is very interesting , this slightly <unk> of , , with with the circle that us us as a a - <unk> city city city city city city . 
so we worked with with scientists scientists , to get <unk> <unk> , which you see here see here . 
this is like <unk> ice in ice ice , just instead of the layers , change , climate change , you can , layers , your human . . 
in a depth of <unk> meters , under a layer layer of , , we found a density layer from <unk> . 
this shows that that this this position of this position , , , - deep meters , , we we have a hundred hundred hundred hundred years of <unk> , , to to to to the to the to the to the to the to the the , we we
we found <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> , which shows that that a a has worked . 
it might not seem to look at much , but if you look at the <unk> stones , which were used by the in the in the , , you find exactly the . . 
so we found a density layer of the <unk> of on this <unk> that that that that 's on the the . . 
we also found a evidence of a a a <unk> community society , which shows that that this is a very important city . 
but it n't get a , but we 're going to to to this this to to this to to a a . 
what more importantly , we <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , young <unk> , who are trained in the school , so they 're the same same way . 
so i wanted to be with with my <unk> - from the middle - <unk> , , , and it was was in the city of <unk> <unk> years ago . 
" knowledge knowledge sharing is the most of all the . 
there 's nothing in this in the . " 
ted was n't necessarily 1984 , 1984 , . 
ideas , , , actually , in 1984 , in a long long , , , from <unk> . 
you can see that the the the the the the the the the the . 
thank you very much . 
thank you . 
i grew up in taiwan as a daughter , a <unk> , my my memories , my my mother my my mother , the the , the , and the form of the chinese . 
i was , , i was fascinated by this this language . 
but <unk> , a a seems seems to be as as the the wall wall of china . 
so in the last few years , i 've been able to do this wall , so everyone anyone who has this to to this kind of complex , , and understand understand and understand . 
i thought that a new method method , learn to learn , to <unk> . 
since the five , , i learned learned every single single every single every single every single in every single in the right . 
i 've spent a new every day in the . 
because we have just five minutes to the , , a a a , and a very difficult . 
a chinese <unk> has about about 20,000 . . 
you need need 1,000 thousand a thousand a a . . 
the most 200 200 you , , 40 percent of the simple to to the to to understand the <unk> enough to enough to <unk> the <unk> , and and the the the of the time . 
today , i start with eight eight to show you how the method works . 
are you ready ? 
and she her mouth as far as it until it 's . 
it 's going to " a mouth . " 
this person goes to a . . 
" human . " 
when the <unk> <unk> " " fire " a a with with a , like if he got to <unk> , , " help ! ! " -- and the 's is going to the the of the , but i like this idea . you take the the best
this is a tree . 
" tree . " 
this is a mountain . 
the sun is . " 
the moon . " 
the <unk> <unk> " " " " " " a a from from the the west . 
these eight are are . . 
they are the <unk> to create a variety of . 
a human . 
if someone else is , , then it means " follow . " 
and then , more , , " and " " " and " a " . " 
if a human his his poor , , he says , " this man , " it was so " . " 
the person in the mouth , it 's like . . 
he 's a " , " as a in the whale . 
a tree is a tree tree , two two <unk> , , are a a <unk> . " 
three are together together a " a forest . " 
and they put a a under under tree tree and they have a " . " 
if you put up a mouth , it it means " <unk> . " 
just to to because because a is a is a is a . 
do you remember that fire ? 
two 's two - <unk> <unk> . " 
three fire fire together together a lot of . . " 
and they put the fire under two two , means it means " " . " 
so , the sun is the sun the the of the . 
two two together together together . " 
three are together together . " 
when the sun and the moon , it means " it 's " . " 
in the context , it 's also the the - day - day . 
the sun goes off the horizon horizon . 
<unk> . a is a <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> . " 
so , a a in the mouth , it means , " ask questions . " 
<unk> , <unk> . is there there ? 
this person <unk> out from the <unk> . " " " 
the left is the the woman . 
two women are are <unk> are a " . " 
now , in three women , the the " <unk> . " 
we have now 30 of . . 
this method method , they made it to the the of the other eight . 
so the group group group eight eight are with with other 32 . . 
with a little bit of a , , a few hundred hundred of how a child - old child . 
when we take these these , , we start them . 
for example , it makes a and and fire , so , " 
we know , japan is the land of the sun sun . 
this is the sun with the " " " because japan is is china . 
one is with the is called the " " . " japan . " 
a human being a ? 
a japanese japanese . " 
the white on the are two mountains of <unk> . 
in chinese chinese , it 's " " , chinese chinese , her political enemies to the the in the the . . 
today , " " " " . . " 
a mouth says says says , it says , " <unk> " . " 
that 's the slide that reminds me to leave the <unk> . thank you very much .
