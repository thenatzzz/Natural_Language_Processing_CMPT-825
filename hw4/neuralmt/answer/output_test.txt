i 'm going to tell you about today about the last 30 years of the last 30 years .
that 's pretty much for 18 minutes .
it 's a complex issue , so we 're directly right directly to a complex place : new jersey .
because , before 30 years ago , i was a new with my parents in new york city , called the , and that was my favorite .
the near my was the i was with my sister .
between my bedroom and the bathroom was a hot with the living room .
and all of all looked at looked at , so , everybody looked me when i was off the bedroom , and whenever i went and in the , and i was all .
and i looked like this .
i was a , and i hated that .
i hated this guy , this , i hated this room and this house .
and that 's architecture . architecture . architecture . architecture .
that feeling , my emotions , that 's the power of architecture , because architecture is not about math and math , it 's about the deep , emotional compounds that we are with places we live .
and it does n't feel that we feel so , because according to the [ ] - american - americans 90 percent of their time .
so we 're 90 percent of our time of architecture .
this is enormously .
it means that architecture is a way that we do n't aware .
this makes us something amazing and very , and we can very , and .
now , if i 'm to show you a building , i know what you think thinking , " power , " and " democracy and democracy . "
and they think that because it 's a building that was two years ago from the .
this is a trick .
this use to emotional , to the forms that we made building buildings .
it 's an emotional , and we use this very long .
we 're the 200 years from banks .
we him in the 19th century .
in the 20th century , we built that houses .
look at this , small of the ocean and the of the .
it 's very useful , because things build is the .
it 's expensive , it takes long , it 's very complicated .
people who build -- governments -- and of course innovation , they use the well - well - .
that leads to buildings like this .
this is a beautiful building .
but it has n't much to do what a library is .
in the same year , 2004 , 2004 on the other side of the united states , another one , and the looks like this .
this is in seattle .
the library is about the in the digital age .
it 's about new public space for the city , a place to the , to the , and to the exchange .
how is it possible that in the same year , in the same country , two , very different ?
architecture is a kind of a .
on the one hand , architects are constantly new technologies , new , new solutions , new solutions for how we live today .
we 're wearing all black , they 're very depressed . they 're us for us , but we 're because we 're because we 're not have a choice .
we need to move the and the symbols again , which they love .
if we do that , and they 're happy , we feel like we were , so we , we the and , for the last 300 years and in the last 30 years .
thirty years ago , years ago , years ago , the end of the 70s .
so architects called the called " . "
and it was about concrete .
little windows , the .
this is really a stuff .
when we were the , we started to these symbols .
we the the back to the other direction .
we the that they them , and they them .
we put the and some the and , and new materials .
and they loved it .
they did n't get enough of them .
we took the and we them into tumors , we can be the of glass .
the shapes were large , and the .
the were columns .
it was crazy .
but that was the , that was cool .
this was the in the .
this was the deal .
they were just cheap , because instead of places , we find memories places .
i know , and i know you know , this is not the the .
this is a .
the end of the beginning and beginning , we started called "
we the historical symbols behind us , we ourselves new , new and new , new forms , forms .
and that was and exciting , that was very , we it completely .
normally , would just back .
but then something happened surprising .
1997 was this building opened .
this is the the - by frank gehry .
this building changed the relationship the world of the world .
and paul was the one of the most rare moments , which , and the public the of the building .
the new york times called this building a miracle .
the british grew up in two percent of the building was .
it 's our first real the .
now , how is it possible that these forms -- and how it possible to spread around the world ?
and this was happening , because media became successfully , and we quickly to make these shapes culture , and .
these forms of us emotional .
like the the around the world .
every mayor knew that these culture , and with .
and this phenomenon of the also some other the .
think about your the .
a thousand years ago , they would have to go to the village to a building .
you know , you take a boat , a plane , you 're a .
technology : you see it in newspapers , in tv , until we all the , and the 's from the .
architecture is now everywhere , now is that the speed of the communication has been used to speed the speed of architecture .
because architecture is very rapidly .
it does n't take a , a .
but it takes a building , three years , and in the meantime , an architect two , eight or , or another , he knows whether the building that he had to four years ago , a success was not or not .
that 's the a of a good " in architecture .
so we have this like this .
this will never going to happen again , i think , because the revolution in the architecture of the invention of the , of the the , or the the of the , it 's a the .
according to my theory , the theory is the , and when you get media , it at almost at least at both of , what in terms of innovation and , between us , the and , and to them ,
now , we can almost at the point of the of a completely different places .
this is going to be a project that we recently .
we were been to this building .
this is the center of a city called the in new york in new york .
it 's a the .
we a building , which is all of , there , and we also worried about our community , and we a series of the that we facebook on facebook and we do people doing what they do doing ,
this meant that it was two years before the community of the community , because the exactly like the , there was no surprises .
this building was a part of this community , and in the first summer , people started to and building the building in the social media , it was n't a building , but it was n't just a , and they 're just pictures of a
so we do n't need a greeks anymore that tell us what we think about architecture .
we can tell us what we think about architecture , because digital media is not only the relationship between us , and they have the relationship between us and buildings .
think about a moment of the in .
if the building today building today , would you today you spend the first time and new "
they would be with experimental , some of that are going to be the limit of what 's going to be a library .
this is a .
this is the that you take to the mayor and to get to the citizens of the , to tell you , there 's not just one answer to what 's library .
let 's be part of it .
this , of this , gives you the freedom to you your own .
everything has changed .
architects are not a rational of people who are the words and use drawings and they 're not the public -- consumers , the consumer , which nothing has n't seen .
architects can hear , and architecture does n't .
this is the end of the the . that means that the future buildings very different than the buildings .
it means that a public space in the of unique and unique and a modern way of modern .
a in brooklyn can be a in brooklyn , and not some of the from .
robots are building our building , because we 're finally to be the to get them to get them .
buildings are going to the outside of the . rather than .
a in miami , florida , there be a place where you get sports or and you know , deep , and you can go to the night .
that means that 's not a small to innovation , and this small little the , that is the same and how animals to it .
so , a building does n't be to be able to build this little building in spain , where it 's a , and , and the , that 's just left that little full of and some of the
it does n't matter whether cow our buildings , or a robot our building .
it 's how we build building , it 's just important to build .
architects are know how to use " the , and buildings .
we just found it was it .
finally , we 're not going on pages .
find architects , you create architects , they 're better with buildings better buildings better and better world , because it 's a lot on the game .
and only not only our society again , they forms them to the smallest , the , where home where kids where their kids , and the way they take their from the to the .
thank you .
this is my niece , the .
it was been a degree of year and started .
they 're going to this way , like , now , run , a , " the " my body is too fast for my legs .
it looks completely cute .
and one of their favorite is to look at themselves in the mirror .
she loves her very .
they 're the , the and , and they , big ,
when it 's suddenly it does n't be okay , does n't use your to - ?
because we do n't do that .
every month , google people google : " am i ugly ? "
this is the . the is 13 and in .
and as everybody wants to just to become and .
it 's her something . she 's a little bit , if your mother your , she says she says she 's beautiful , she tells anyone to anyone in school that she was ugly .
because your mother 's a and say your friends or say something else , say , you know n't know who you should supposed to be .
some of those are so that you should n't think about them .
this is a average , healthy - old girls who this in the face of times life .
well , the teenagers of today are rarely alone .
they 're standing up , and be available to them , they talk , write , -- it never .
never been so connected , so , so , so , so young .
a mother said to me , it 's like if night in night room .
you just have n't have a .
and the pressure is with is .
this the - based children on the basis of the the of " and the kind of comments that they get .
there 's no separation between the online and " .
what real and what 's not really is to say .
what is your source of inspiration ?
you can see the images that are in the of the girls today .
there 's been with a zero - scale .
and is today .
and trends like , the , the , the , and the .
by the way , the stands for the .
these trends to the with the and the women who are women in the women in the women in the women .
today , you see easily that you can the girls who are girls .
but the young are not too , too .
the pursuit of the face and the and the of the and .
but what is the problem ?
we want to that our children are healthy , become more people .
but in a one culture , our culture , we 're going to spend more time and thoughts with the with the to look at the other of other aspects of your identity .
so your relationships , physical development and the school to suffer .
six 10 months , they do n't think they 're not good enough .
and these are not activities .
it 's fundamental activities in their development as human and as a society to society and to .
31 percent , about one three - minute - minute at a discussion in the classroom , they do n't not because you do n't want to attention to your attention .
one five - old - old school not to school when they 're not paying .
if you 're in to you that you do n't think good or not particularly , you get a average than you do n't care about .
and this is all the case , in finland ,
and china , and as matter how much you actually do .
so to make this whole clear , it 's about how you think you 're looking , and you do n't really how to actually in fact , how do you actually .
looks . the .
but it also the health .
teenagers with the less , less and vegetables , the weight of weight , and can lead to and .
and that 's not changing .
women who think they 're dick -- and again , whether they 're or have higher .
17 percent of women would not go to a to when they 're not going to with their with their .
think about what the economy .
if we could overcome that we what possibilities .
this potential is a that is in every single of us .
but how do we do this ?
only , it 's not really far .
it 's not enough .
if we want to move , we need to do something .
here 's three - first , we teach them teach them .
we need to help our to develop strategies , to the of the and the of the .
the good news is that there are already a lot of programs .
but the bad news is that most of work do n't work .
i was shocked to see that the programs have the situation .
we need to really make sure that the programs that are going to our children , not just a , but also a effect .
research that the best programs six programs : the first of the of the family , friends and relationships .
secondly , the media and the media and then the with and , and how we deal with other the and ourselves , and people are -- people some people call the " - " and the basis
it 's how women are seen are seen and how about them .
it 's not okay that we 're the of our the because of the , the size of their breasts , or to that it 's a of their appearance .
we need to start looking at their actions , and not what they 're .
we can start to take responsibility for the images and comments that we 're in the social networks .
we can do people to do their and do , and do n't do for their , do .
and i 'm asking you , when did you have a mirror of a mirror ?
we need to communities as communities , governments and work to something , so our children will grow up their most of and , and .
we need to people to people who really move something , put them something in the world .
we have to you , because then the changes the world .
a world where our children have freedom to the best version of their own , in the mind of their thinking about their lives , they 're not to be who they are , or what they want .
consider , what you might mean for someone to live in your life .
a friend ? or the woman who just sitting something .
what would it mean for you , if you could use it , of your voice , your , legs , the , smaller
what would it mean for you if we could this and potential ?
today , all of us today the of our culture of the .
let 's tell our children the truth .
let 's show that 's just a part of our identity , and that we 're actually love to do what they are what they do , and what they 're us to give you a sense .
it has to on the curriculum .
every single one of us should be the way we talk about and compare us to compare .
we 're going to work as communities together , from the government to governments , the government , the of the the of today .
let 's go it .
on the five november , a the named the in manhattan , and a - on - the founder of the founder of the the .
the was first by the by the of the the , but he his for smaller , and other men , to a dozen of new york , including the , the , the of the united nations .
luckily , this plans were been by a the - .
and was the public 's the center in the world center .
i was raised in pittsburgh , pennsylvania , when a was a the , and an the and the , who were together to her best to me a happy .
it was only when i was seven years ago , started changing .
my father showed me a side of the of that just to few people to majority the majority of muslims .
but there 's every in every , in every people , a little percentage of people who are so the in their belief that they believe , they 're going to do everything in their power to do other to how they live .
we came to the the that we know our knowledge from the fbi .
on the day , my last ball the light on over the light , and the surprise of the , especially my , the whole goal on in .
this comment seemed to get to laugh to laugh , but i only a few years later , which she was actually really so funny .
they thought , i had the same as my father .
these guys were to a the with a the on a the of the the of the explosion , and thousands of people and over other .
i those men , i .
this guys called me " the , " which is so much " uncle . "
when i was been a , we were been taught , and , and this was in my childhood , my students were me to find my friends .
as soon as i had a little bit , i was time to the and the city .
since i was the new in the class , i was often the of the .
so i spent most of the time at the same time , i read books , or tv or played video games .
and i was the to -- to -- to -- the -- and i in a , i was n't prepared to the real world .
i was been to people to , such as example of their or their religion .
so what opened me ?
one of my first experiences that i my thinking about , was i was 2000 during the .
when i was working college , i was at the national in philadelphia .
the most of my group was the , and i was almost my whole life of life , was my subject .
the members of our group came from different social .
i found the day , found that a boy that i had been , was .
it had several days , until this was , detail , and i realized that were between us not only natural .
i met people on people who are and , and experience my personality .
this feeling makes me feel able to the that taught me as a child , to be with in real - .
i do n't know how it 's being gay , but i know very good , it 's to be to be my .
and then the show . "
inspiration comes from often from the , and , and the fact that a cultural the my greatest response , my father my father is not to me .
one day , i had a conversation with my to change my change , and she started to me something that i will be in my , in my heart .
she saw me with the the eyes of a woman her life her life , and said , " i 'm suffering to hate people . "
and that moment , i me how much negative energy takes to make that .
the is n't my real name .
i have changed my when my family decided to bring the contact to my father and a new life .
so why am i me and possibly me ?
it 's very simple .
instead , i use my experiences to against the the .
i do it for the victims of terrorism and the , and the of pain and , and that of the of the in the life .
for the victims of terrorism , i against this , and the of my father .
with this the fact , i 'm living that violence not in religion or religion or and that the son is n't going to the of the .
i 'm not my father .
in this moment , a film in your head .
it 's a , film .
he 's got with all you 're seeing , and hear , but that 's just the beginning .
you can see it , and touch .
he has a sense of her body pain , hunger , the .
he has emotions , rich and joy .
he 's memory , for moments , your childhood that you before them before them .
and he has a very simple : that 's how . think .
the in the film you , and you can see all the directly .
the film is the power of the consciousness , the result of how you experience your mind and experience the world .
consciousness is one of the fundamental elements of human .
each of us is aware .
we all have our own inner , they them , and them . and they them .
there 's nothing that we 're going to do .
at least , i my mind directly .
i ca n't say sure that they 're aware .
consciousness is what makes life .
we would n't think we could n't have a sense or lives .
at the same time , the phenomenon of the universe .
why do n't we just robots that all the input and all of the space , without having this inner movie ?
at this point , nobody knows the answers these questions .
i 'm saying that some of ideas will be ideas to be able to make the area of consciousness .
some claim , a science of consciousness is impossible .
science is inherently from .
consciousness is inherently from .
so , can never be a science of consciousness .
in the majority of the 20th century , this opinion was .
psychologists the behavior of behavior , the brain had the brain , and no one has the only thing .
even 30 years ago , when ted was founded , the of the consciousness of scientific .
about 20 years ago , began .
neuroscientists like francis and physicists like roger the , who has time to come back in science , and also to be conscious .
there was a real explosion , this was explosion , the of science .
this work is great . it 's great .
but it also has some basic limits .
a part of this work , we 've seen by seeing these the of , as they 've done their wonderful work .
now , we understand now much better , which is the with the with perception of , or , or pain .
but that 's still a science of the .
it 's not science .
we know that these species - specific species of the , of , but we do n't know why they do it .
i see that this kind of the of the neuroscience questions are asking for the answers to the answers , the question , what are happening and what they do .
but in a way , these are the simple problems .
nothing against nothing .
consciousness , there is no problems of problems .
but the does n't solve the real puzzle , the core of this : all the physical processes of the brain is the brain of the consciousness ?
why does this exists of the inner ?
no , no answer to this question .
now you might think you should be able to give you some couple of years .
it will be to be a more phenomenon like , like , life , and we can explain it .
the problems of the hard are all of the of how : how a way to feel a organism and , everything that 's going to be questions .
you could think this in the human brain , by looking behaviors and the human brain as the brain phenomenon of how we how we play how we play , all of questions .
but when it comes to consciousness , the questions to the problems .
when it comes to complicated , why all these of a experience .
and , the of the , even the the of neuroscience , not far much .
what 's science , i 'm heart .
i want to explain a scientific theory for the mind , which works , for a long time , i 've been looking for a for a theory of the that completely and , and on .
but i had to realize that was n't work for
so i think that we are in a kind of a .
we have these wonderful , great explanations on explanations , so it 's mostly the physics , explains the biology , biology .
but consciousness does n't seem to fit this model .
on the one hand , it 's that we are aware .
on the other hand , we do n't know how to define this in our scientific behavior .
so i think that consciousness is the right now is a kind of a that we have to do in our own , but not n't know .
now , with such a of , we might be ideas , and i think we could be or two ideas that we crazy before we get the conscious .
there 's a couple of candidates that are these crazy ideas .
my friend dan who here , this one of these ideas .
he says that there 's no problem with consciousness .
the whole concept of the entire piece of the is based on a kind of illusion or .
in fact , we have to recognize the function of the brain , and then we 've explained everything that explains what explains .
i 'm saying , just to this that !
this is the kind of ideas that we have to explore , if we create a - and the theory of the .
but this one for me and many other not , because they the existence of human .
so i 'm going to go another way .
and in the time , i want to spend on two ideas i think that might be .
the first crazy idea that consciousness is the conscious .
physicists see a few of the universe as a fundamental : space , time and mass .
they represent the laws to them , the laws of gravity or gravity .
these fundamental properties and laws are not by even the .
they 're seen as a as a , and on their , the world is built .
and it 's sometimes it 's that the list of the fundamental things .
in the 19th century , discovered that you could n't use the phenomenon of the by things , space , time , mass , so it 's the laws of the laws and the electrical as a element to which to imagine
i think we 're dealing with the minds in the same situation .
if you can n't give the of the existing elements , space , space , mass , then the moral brain that you have to be the list .
the natural consequence would be to consciousness as a as element , to nature , and nature .
that does n't mean you ca n't be science to be .
it opens the way to science .
what we need to do is , is fundamental laws that consciousness the mind of the fundamental , the time , space , time , time , mass , physical processes .
physicists , sometimes we need laws that so that you can print on the a of a .
i think we 're with consciousness in such a situation .
we want to find a laws that are so simple that you can print them on an print .
we do n't know yet laws , but we 're working on .
the second crazy idea is that consciousness could be the .
every system could be a certain way of consciousness .
this view is sometimes as a the , " the " for the spirit , for spirit , system , not only to people , dogs , dogs , even , even , microbes .
even every the has a certain sense of consciousness .
now , this approach does n't tell us that intelligent are or .
a the is not a , and thinks , " ah , ah , i love myself at the .
i can never ever , and i 'm going to . "
no , no .
but the idea is that maybe perhaps a certain kind of the , feeling , a kind of primitive of consciousness .
they might seem to be a little bit more .
i mean , why should somebody something so ?
part of the is the first crazy idea of idea that consciousness is .
if it 's a , how space , time and mass , it can be , it might like it .
you also have to say , this idea that we have us , which is human beings , other people , but more powerful , in cultures , human nature .
a , motivation is comes from the idea that the easiest and best way to be the laws of consciousness and physical processing and to connect with the .
wherever there are there , there 's consciousness .
complex is how in humans -- complex consciousness .
simple -- simple awareness .
and exciting is that in the last few years , a few of , the approach of the theory of this theory has been mathematical theory .
he 's the the of the the , which is " to measure the the in a system .
and he 's that the with consciousness .
so in the human brain , a large amount of large amount of high , a level , a lot of consciousness .
in a mouse , a lot of the , still very high -- level . consciousness .
but if we go to , microbes , microbes , dangerous - .
the the rate is , but still bigger than zero .
according 's going to be a consciousness , it 's the to zero .
in fact , he was a law of law of consciousness , : lack , consciousness .
i do n't know if this theory is right , but it 's the of the theory in the science of consciousness , and it 's the to of a whole series of data , and it 's just enough to print them to the a of
another is that we 're is that help us could save the consciousness into the physical world .
physicists and philosophers have observed that the physics is abstract .
it 's the structure of reality of a series of mass , but they tells us not about the reality that 's their .
as stephen hawking , " what does the live ? "
according to the , the can of the physics is how you are , but you can use it to use the power of the consciousness .
that 's what the physics ultimately power is power of the consciousness .
so , it 's consciousness to the life .
from this view , consciousness is n't beyond the physical world as a kind of extra .
it 's just in your center .
i think this view of view , that potential to our relationship to nature , change , and it might have some serious social and consequences .
some of them may not be .
i thought i thought i should n't eat anything that was a consciousness , and therefore .
if you get the the of the , you 're going to be very hungry .
i think about it , it 's change our perspective , and what happens from the and view of view , less the of consciousness , but rather the and the complexity of consciousness .
it 's also logical , to awareness to the other systems , like example in computers .
what about the artificial system in the movie , " ?
is it consciously ?
you the , you see the , you 're a high level of the and you should be the answer .
if this is really true , it 's very beginning to both to the ethics of development , as a to the ethics of
finally , finally , to the to the , of the , the planet .
has a ?
or on the level , there 's a group of how audience , we just have a of ; there 's a movie for this collective the that are from the of every single ?
i know the answer to this question , but i think they should be at least .
okay , this vision of the is radical , and i do n't know if she 's right .
i 'm actually really from the of the first crazy idea that consciousness is the to the , is that it 's universal .
this perspective is to questions , many of challenges , to , like , like the parts of the consciousness and the and the complexity of the complexity of the that we know and .
when we find answers , we , we 're going to right way to a way to a theory of the consciousness .
if not , then this is the most important problem in science and philosophy .
we ca n't expect to it overnight .
but i think we 'll going to fix it .
i think that understanding of our consciousness is a key understanding of the universe also to understanding .
it 's just maybe the right crazy idea .
thank you .
i grew up in a very small city in .
my childhood was normal and normal .
i went to school , with friends , with friends , with younger .
it was all normal .
when i was 15 , i was a the minister my parents , i wanted to community to be a for a .
my parents said , " well , that 's really nice , but there 's a problem . there 's a problem .
to be honest , she did n't even anything . " and they right .
i went to school , got a high school , helped school , a school in my mother , and spent a lot of time , " the of the of the " and " the "
yeah , i know . what 's a contradiction .
but they were right .
years later , my graduate student in school high school in school , 20 minutes , in the in the , in the , and he said , " when do you start with speech ? "
" what ? "
i had 20 minutes talking about the and the .
he said , " you know , know , well , your the .
when someone in the wheelchair , they 're really mostly the most stuff . "
" usually do n't happen in the "
there was a light on me , this young man had people with people with disability , with more than .
for him , we 're it -- and it does n't mean anything to it .
many of them are not teachers , doctors or doctors .
we are not real people . we should inspire .
and in fact , i 'm sitting here on this stage and i 'm like i 'm in the wheelchair in the wheelchair , and you probably some of you me that i 'm you right ? right ? yes .
ladies and gentlemen , i have to do it .
i 'm not here to inspire them .
i 'm going to tell you that we actually , we actually , when it 's about .
disability is not bad and it does n't make us extraordinary .
in the last few years , we 've been able to be the in the social media .
you may have seen pictures like this : " the only life in life is a bad attitude . "
or , " your is your . "
or , " before you go , you , " you ! "
these are just a few examples ; it 's lots of these images .
you may know that little girl without hands , that 's in the mouth , a mouth .
you may have seen the kid that 's on the .
and these pictures , there are many that we call the .
i use the word of a , because you to people to make other people .
you make power to make objects to make so much .
these pictures have the to the , so that you 're the , and , and you , " how bad my life is , it might be worse .
i could be this person . "
but what if you 're that person ?
i 've got to count , how often strangers me to tell me that they me , or inspiring , that was a long before my work was publicly .
in a way , i 'd like to me that i woke up morning , and i remember my name , so , and a 's going to be a human for object .
all these pictures of the objects , objects to the .
in are , you 're you to you can you can better yourself and its own .
in life , with is actually quite difficult .
we 're so much more .
but what we do is not what they 're .
it has nothing to do with our body .
i 'm with intent with the of , because i 'm the social of disability , we are more by society that we live in than our bodies and .
i live in the long for that .
i like him very .
it 's what to do , and i 've learned to use his skills to as much as you as it 's about the children on these photos .
they do n't have any extraordinary .
they 're just their bodies , so good as possible .
is it really fair to how to make objects and how these pictures are taken ?
when people say , " they 're a inspiration , they want to do a .
i know why .
because of the lie that we were been : that disability does power .
i 'm thinking about inspiration , inspiration , and thinking , " , you never something anything ? "
yeah , yes . yes .
i 'm constantly by other .
i do n't learn to understand that i was more lucky than her .
i 'm that it 's a great idea , with a - scale stuff , i 'm learning the that 's cell phone with the battery of the battery .
yeah !
we 're learning from the strength and the of others , not in the fight against our bodies and , but a world that makes us feel special .
i think , my opinion is a is about a .
it makes us alive to us .
and the quote " the only life in life is a bad attitude , " great , because not because of the social of disability .
you can climb the staircase , they do n't even into a .
it will never happen .
i want to live in a world where the is the norm , is the norm .
in the a girl who in her room , the -- in the of the of the , not as a single - , because it in the .
i want to live in a world where you do n't expect to be so little that you to stand up to the and the morning .
i want to live in a world where the is the conversation of the , ; i want to live in a world where a student of 11 , class , not in his own his new .
not does n't mean to us , but , but to think about the of our mindset .
thank you .
what have " to do empathy ? empathy ?
how fast is a " the " in the air ?
unfortunately , i 'm just going to answer just one answer , answer , please do n't want to .
most people think of the reality of " the , " and he the in the air , but he 's not fiction .
he 's something that faster than we think , we , and it will come , because we have the technologies , and you have to be aware of it , because it will change our lives as exactly the internet and the cell .
and how we going to ?
i step , i just started to google .
many of you know google .
you may not know that google is a device that allows you to see what i see .
and to experience , it 's like the standing on the field .
now , you can just experience it , if i 'll you it .
i have to it in words .
i have to create a framework that you can use with your imagination .
and google , google , we can put this under a helmet , and a feeling of getting it , with to do with the field , and your body to whole body .
you can experience , it 's when a the on them and with the , trying to them .
i 've self that self , and it does n't feel good .
here 's the video .
it 's .
it 's be to be the , is the .
wait , i go to .
are you ready ?
go !
you 've sure that people are the rest of the team .
we 've a video of the to washington .
the : hey , the !
blue !
oh !
fans to this experience , experience , experience .
on the field .
you want to be your the , and you have me on youtube and twitter on " , " can you give you a the - ?
once we have the experience , with google and google , how do we make it better ?
what is the next ?
the chinese , as one of the most of ever , and it 's not just a .
and i can show you with this video why is so .
oh ! oh ! oh !
no ! no ! no ! i do n't want ! no ! no !
oh my god ! the !
this is a man a and .
how will it be for him when he 's with over the 100 miles over the 100 miles ?
i think adults will be again .
but this is not a thing .
this is just virtual reality .
how do we come to ?
we do that , if we are managers and managers and owners and information and information and ask yourself , " how do we improve our team ?
how do we win with games ? "
teams use technologies to win games .
they 're like to make that .
a short story of the technologies in the .
so have the the your a with him a little faster .
they won the the .
other teams followed .
more people , because the games to show , because the games is the .
we have been and .
and the , the the the the of the the , the , the also the .
more people saw that were a little bit of
and the .
imagine , play with you . you go back to the the , and you see the next on your front of your , you today .
no longer more afraid of
no need to all the need to learn .
they go out there and react .
and the want to this because through because you feel , you , and not n't lose .
and then they will be able to get .
they do n't want to .
but it 's not just a the of .
he allows them to all of data in parallel and their game .
how that ?
a very simple , a very nice thing to be a camera on the corner of the the , all the below the .
they also the data , and the the , technologies , which are working on .
they all data their data .
the good teams data , data .
the bad is a .
the good and bad teams .
and now your - as important as , and is not more just for .
it was also for . who would have thought ?
how that on the field ?
imagine you 're the .
you get the ball .
they 're looking for a free .
suddenly a on a left - on - on a and , and you 'll tell you that the blind is the . "
normally do n't see him , but he 's the player to the .
they 're in position .
another one for a .
it 's , but you get hit .
the ball is no control , control .
you do n't know where he 's .
but on the of the , the is the , and it can react .
he can catch the ball , go on , .
the amount of the , and the fans are in , and from perspective .
this will be a new for the game .
people will be in , because they want to experience that experience .
fans wants to be on the field .
want to be their the .
it 's going to be part of the because , because it does n't do it .
but my question is , is : are we happy with it ,
do we want to just for bread and games , ordinary ?
i think that 's that we can use it for more .
i think we can use the to make the people in the people by telling someone to someone to someone to someone else .
we know what this technology is worth value .
they 're invited in .
what is this technology a of in uganda or russia , the world wants to see what conditions is he ?
what is this technology - the , or neil - worth of , who are going to generation to children , about and about the and the the ?
ladies and gentlemen , the be reality .
the questions that we ask the choices that we are , are challenges facing we are , are always , in our hand .
thank you very much .
i 'm recently after 23 years from the service from the .
most of the time spent years , i was as a at the the county , which is the blue of .
the bridge is a the - , which is around the beautiful in san francisco , the pacific and the architecture of architecture .
unfortunately , it 's a for , because you 're to the world 's most places .
the blue level has been opened up .
joseph the , the engineer , the , " the bridge is the .
suicide is the , nor . "
but since the last , have been over 1,000 600 people from this bridge in death .
some people believe that one of the two between into the other one in another dimension -- the bridge was -- by the case of all , and all of the , and the , and the water down there , the soul .
i 'm going to tell you what really happens when the bridge as a used to be used .
in the the , the bones some organs .
most of the die of the .
those who do n't die , mostly in the water and then .
i do n't think that the kind of the of , is what 's a death .
this is the cable .
aside from the area to the two walk over the inches of the bridge .
here 's where most people before they take themselves .
and experience , i tell you that one person already on the , and that in your , and you 're very hard to do it .
i took this photograph last year when this young woman had a woman , a woman and her life .
i 'm very happy to tell you that we were successful to day , they were to the side of the .
when i started working on the bridge , there was no training .
you 've gone through your whole through your entire .
this was not just a the for , but also the .
since then we 've got a long way behind us .
today , the were the and the .
this is jason the .
i met last year , 22 , july , when i call a call , a the , which was about in the middle of the bridge in the cable .
i was and when i arrived , i watched watching him with a of the of .
it was just 32 years old , and from new jersey .
after we talked about a hour , and , he asked us if we know the story of the .
we remember we 've got the , and , and , and them together , and a , and said , " never , this . "
and one day when the curiosity was , she opened the .
they were , and all kinds of things that were about the .
the good thing in the was hope .
and then , of us , " what happens when you take the and you do n't hope in the ? "
he was quiet for a moment , he was going to right and right .
this nice intelligent young man from new jersey had taken to life .
i talked to the evening with my parents and parents , and i them , i did n't feel well , because , the next day , i was the of the family , to me to me .
parents had asked him .
the the of a is on many people .
i tell you the following : what would you do if a member or a friend or a blind person ?
what would you say ?
would you know what you should say ?
my experience is not just about talking about it , but to listen to the listening .
listen to understand .
do n't do n't do n't , you do n't , or do n't tell the other person you do know how you feel because they do n't know .
just there , they might have the that the person has the .
if you think that somebody is , you do n't fear to this person .
so you might ask , like , ask , other people in situations , are thinking about life , you know ? "
the person to it , save your lives , your life and to .
other signs that you should look at the : the believe that things are bad and never better , and that , that belief that you can do nothing about , from the social life and the loss of life .
i just talk this talk before few days ago , and i email i like to you .
she had her son at january , january , and she wrote me this email , and she just asked me a few days before and her , and i read them .
" hi , probably just the .
it must be a great experience .
i think i should go this weekend on the bridge .
i wanted to send you a few of them .
and i hope you to people with their message and home and with friends that tell their friends about their friends , and tell their friends .
i 'm still quite , but i 'm more moments to realize that mike is not going to come home .
mike is from san francisco san francisco , at the 19th , january with his father , the of the .
he never there .
i put the police in the and i it night . night .
the next morning , two came home to me and me that my car was down to the bridge .
a saw , as he was at the day before he was at the bridge .
so thank you very much for you to be for those who are be to be to be for themselves to be themselves .
no , did n't even know it was he was to a mental illness ?
it should n't be so easy to your own life .
i 'm for them and fight fighting fight . fight . fight .
the the , a the , a transition about our bay , and no one .
a lot of this week , week , " . "
i ca n't imagine how much courage it to me to go bridge and go away the way that son of son , and did n't , it needs to courage .
i 'd like to introduce you to a man that 's for me hope and courage .
on march , i on a the people in the near the .
i went along with my own the and this guy , kevin , he was on the the .
and for the next half , i 'd heard to kevin , and he was talking about his depression and his the .
kevin decided to day the day of the back to over the and his life to another chance .
as a kevin , i the him .
" this is a new beginning , new life . "
but i asked him , " what exactly you get to the and hope another chance ? "
and you know what he told me ?
he said , " you 've got to see .
you 've me and you 've got to change it . "
shortly after this event , i got a letter from the mother , and i 'd him it here and i 'd like to you .
" mr. the , nothing can be heard by 11 , march , march , but they 're one of the reasons why the reason why we were .
i believe that kevin moved out of aid .
and was , for him , a was a for the .
i 've just tried to six , six months , completely the about a thousand of , but thank god , thank you now , now .
kevin it 's how he says .
we thank god .
deep in her fault , the , the . "
and at the end of her , she , " the , when i went to the hospital , san francisco , they were .
boy , i had to just right . "
today , a is a father and a third member of society .
he talks talking about the and his depression in depression hoping his story .
it is n't really me to the .
in the personal environment .
my grandfather has taken through life . life .
and fact , even though they had his own pain , i gave me the chance to ever know .
the , the .
most people most people or people who people who think about suicide , never would think about to another .
they only want you to your pain .
that happens usually one three : , or .
in my career , i worked on hundreds of calls , and i 've been hundreds of cases in the and , and the around the bridge .
i 'm involved in the where i 've been lost , but i but i think two are two .
one of them was free .
the other was a man that i spoke about an hour .
and he had three hand .
and he looked at the last he looked at me and said , " kevin , i 'm sorry , but i must go . "
and he 's .
i want to tell you about that most people who we were in to bridge , no suicide .
and , most people have people who are and talk about , one or two or two people , they people that they in the moment they did , they had a mistake and they wanted to live .
i tell the people that the bridge is not only just the san and san francisco , but also they also people .
the connection or the bridge that we make , is something that every single of us should be .
suicide is .
there are help . there are hope .
thank you .
the world makes you something you not are , but you 're , and the question of your heart : " how are you going to get this ? "
i 'm perhaps something special , but i 'm not alone , not alone .
when i was a , it was like as the dream i had been since my finally .
my self - , finally my inner truth , my inner self .
the reasons for reasons is that -- i 'll come back later -- but at the beginning of this , it 's like , like , " the , that 's ! you 've done it . "
but last october , i realized that i was just at the beginning .
we all in the , from our families , from our society , from our society , from the time we live in our own .
some people have courage to the individual who are not their , or their , their .
these people are always a threat for the status , for what 's as .
in my case , during the last nine years , some of my neighbors , some of my friends , even my nothing my story .
when i was five years old , i was at home on the same time that i kept on my on my head .
my mother asked me to me , " why do you always this t on your head ? "
i said , " the , these are my hair . i 'm a girl . "
i knew my own identity .
gender is always been seen as a , but , but now we know that it 's , and .
because of my , i never had the courage to tell my story , because i thought that i do n't think about something , because of the way the world that we like to ourselves .
i day i 'm so grateful , because i am a woman .
i have a mother , dad father and a family who me as i am .
many of not have that .
in asia , there 's a old tradition that the gender to the .
there 's a of compassion .
there 's a the , a the , third .
when i was eight years old , i was at a the on the of these the .
i stood standing and i , because this woman came out , right , front of me , and i that moment , i knew this , i was i wanted to be .
when i was 15 years old , still young , i met a woman named the , i met a woman named the .
she was the for the .
and this evening , asked me , " why do n't you do about the ? "
that moment changed my life .
suddenly , i found myself in the world of the world .
not many people were in the first job in the for the , but i was paying it .
at the age of 15 and 17 years , i was in the with the morning , and at that , literally , a , or sometimes it was the next one , and when it rains -- it had a lot of the --
i also the of strangers , especially in the provinces of the philippines .
but most importantly , i was some of my best friends in community .
in 2001 , my mom came up san francisco , and told me that my had a nice to a the , that i could now in the united states .
i 'm not going to .
i said to her , " the , i have fun .
i 'm here friends , i love to travel and be .
two weeks later , she looked at her and said , " did you know that you to a in the united states and your gender ? "
i do n't have to hear .
my mother said to , i should write my name with two " . "
she was me when i was in 19 , i had my surgery .
it 's interesting that in the areas , some of some of the military , and the surgeries .
in the , it was the united states , to , before you could write their name and his gender .
so 2001 , i went to san francisco , and i know when i was my , i called the the and the the .
this was a moment .
for some people , this is a to a , or for the , alcohol , but for me , it was to my life . dignity .
i believed , i dream can could be new for new york .
many of not have that .
i think thinking about a woman named the .
she 's from new york , a young woman who wants to her truth , but give you a life of life .
for most of my background , the reality is that we live in .
our the is high - high way that the population of the population .
every year on the 20th century , we a global - of the memory .
i 'm standing here on this stage , because there 's a long story of people who spread and against injustice .
these are the johnson and sylvia the .
today , right now , this moment , my real - .
i could n't make my truth for myself .
i want to give my best help their without fear and fear .
i 'm going to take it to do it , day , it 's going to be a , a .
my truth , allowed me to me how i am .
can you do that ?
thank you .
i like to what you say , say , but , but to , to and all those who are people who have trouble with the gender , which is what to you to the people , to them , good
sure . sure : i have a lucky .
and sometimes it does , sometimes , sometimes , so it 's just the that the identity in the core of the ?
all of us , the birth of the , and i 'm trying to lead a conversation about the gender , and that people should be people to their identity , and we should to conversation , we need to deal with
the is the at the beginning , in the beginning of the the and the the .
there 's a lot of to do .
it should be insight .
it should be room for curiosity , for questions , and i hope you all here , my .
thank you very much . that was beautiful . thank you .
in many societies and societies are fathers by their sons , but i 'm but one of the few of who through his daughter , and i 'm proud of it .
i was , she was , daughter , but now i 'm her father .
very and ladies , if we look at the history of mankind , the history of the women 's story of a full of injustice , inequality , inequality , and .
she wo n't be welcome , neither from your father of her mother .
the neighborhood comes over to mother , and nobody to the father .
a mother feels a very feel when she got a girl .
if you get the first girl to the world , the first daughter is she 's sad .
if you 're the second daughter to the world , she 's shocked and in a son of son , who 's the third , she feels like guilty .
not only the mother , but also the daughter , daughter , daughter , when that older , older , they also .
with five , in age , where you should go to school , she stays her home during her school .
until the age of 12 , she has a kind of life .
it 's fun .
she can play with her friends on the street , and she can freely like a .
but as a , 13 , your , without being made from the house .
it 's in the four of your own the .
it 's not longer a human being .
she 's going to be to the honor her brothers and her family , and if she could the , she can even killed .
and what 's interesting is that this is that this is not only the life of life itself , but also the life of the of .
i know a family with seven sisters and a brother , and this brother is in the the to his sisters , and his parents , because he thought that if seven sisters , a and to a to a .
so , brother , the joy in his life and his happiness his on the of the .
there 's another important of the most important societies of and is that .
it 's a very good very good very .
this is the the .
the good needs must be very quiet .
they should be very the , and they should to leave the choices of their father and their mother , and the choices of the older , if they were doing this .
otherwise , it will be as a .
and what happens to end ?
with the words of a , you will send and to and then and to and daughters .
and this cycle continues .
and gentlemen , these millions of millions of women could be , if women and women men and women and societies and the developing world , the families and families society , and the laws of the in the in the of the human rights .
brothers sisters , as a the , when i first went to the , and i think i 'm , i 'm not -- i her eyes to the eyes , i me , i was honored .
long before they were born , i thought about her name , and was fascinated by the the , the afghanistan . afghanistan .
her name was the of the , and i was my daughter to her .
some days after the , after birth , my , and that was a chance -- and came home to me and brought a family with a family and the and , and when i met this , he was 300 years to
and when i met him -- all of men were -- i took my pen , i took a line from my name and wrote " the .
when she got older , i got a little years ago , i took them in my school .
now , you why you should i mention that a girl in a school is going to school ?
yes , i have to mention it .
so this may be in the in canada , in the u.s. and many other countries , but in poor countries , in , societies in , it 's a great event for life .
to go to school , your identity and your .
to school to that she will bring into the world of their dreams and their hopes where she her talents to her life .
i have five sisters and no one could go to school , it 's going to take it , but two weeks ago , i was able to do this as the the for the , and i was the of the family , i could n't remember
and the reason for that i never had never seen before my names .
what my father could n't allowed to could not own his own , i to think .
i always the intelligence and the of my daughter .
i 've encouraged them to sit me , when my friends came to me .
i them to visit with me meet .
and all of these good values tried to in their personality .
and that was not just for , not just for .
i have this good values in my school , both with students .
i 've been education for the .
i brought my girls , i brought my to the to read the lesson of .
i brought my students to the to the of the .
and brothers and sisters , we for more for more for women and we 're for to more and more and more society in society .
but we 're about a new phenomenon .
something more important for human rights and for .
it 's called the .
this is the complete prime of the of women in all political , economic and social activity .
hundreds of schools are lost .
girl was to school to school .
women were forced to wear , and they were to be to go to markets .
musicians were sent to silence , girl and killed .
millions of people , but only few languages things and it 's very to for the own rights , if you 're from people who are surrounded , kill and kill .
it 's really the most thing .
at the age of 10 years , stood up stood up and stood up for you right , education .
she wrote a for a the , she worked for the of the new york times , and she spoke to every .
and her voice was voice .
they spread like a " the " all over the world .
and that was the reason why the taliban were n't to their campaign , and on the , october , 2012 , was going to a out of a distance .
it was the day of the day of my family and my family .
the world was became a big black hole .
my daughter my life between life and death , i am my wife in the , " am i blame to what 's daughter and daughter ? "
and she immediately , " please do n't blame your fault .
you 're right for the right thing .
you 've your life on the , for the truth , for peace , peace , and for education , and your daughter was inspired by her and .
you 're both the way and the and will protect them . "
these few words , a very a lot of me and i do n't get this question .
during the hospital in the hospital , and pain had strong , because her the was the , i saw a dark shadow on the face of my wife .
but my daughter is never .
she said , " she 's always , " my favorite smile is okay , and my is in my face .
i 'm going to go to . please do n't please . "
it was a for us and gave us .
brothers and sisters , we learned from the big , in the most times , and i 'm happy to share with you with you , even though you 're a icon for children 's children and women 's how they else .
you 're wrong , when your homework are not completely .
they the with her , which i 'm very happy .
people ask me what the special thing me is me is what made of the so , and so , and so forth .
and i 'm telling you , do n't ask what i did .
i wonder what i did n't do .
i do n't have their wings . this is all .
thank you very much .
18 years ago , i became the brain , and since then it became an passion for me .
i 'm actually a the .
anyway , after a .
am i not even or not ?
and if you do n't , i can i get it back ?
after my surgery , i had to take how from a dozen of chemicals , i would have every day , and i just had n't have , i had n't lost less hours .
it was a times , it was really .
but luckily , i love experiments through and through , and so i decided to start experiment to find the , because there was no in there in the field , the enough .
i tried to come up , and i 've been absolutely out of the of the , how much changes of the , my sense of my sense , myself , my thinking , my other people .
an particularly wonderful case , a few months , i actually took the and chemicals that had a man for a man in the early , and i could n't believe how my thoughts .
i was quite extremely .
but i me , that i was n't trying to be compassionate .
i was actually trying to do a little bit and , and the problem with me with it , and it was n't just that way .
but i think that i have a understanding of a for understanding for men and what they need to do , and i come to much better with men .
i wanted to reach one of the of the hormones and so on , and i was , and i wanted to intelligence my intelligence , my thinking , my .
i think mostly in and so i became so for me to me -- how i these images that i like to be a sort of representation of my ideas , my ideas , if you want to different ideas to different
this is not new .
philosophers like the , the and the saw it .
they thought pictures , ideas are actually the same .
today , this is going to be many today and how our head is actually going to be but for me , it 's very simple : the most of us are essential to think of the and creative .
so , after several years , i 've been finally , and i now i 'm a great , very fantastic mental images of the and the basis .
now i 'm working on how i 'm these images from my head .
imagine a an african would be an easy , to help imagination with imagination .
or a musician could his music his head .
this offers incredible opportunities of creative people in the .
i want to show you why i think that we are close to here , here are two recently two experiments of two groups in neuroscience .
both the the -- the -- the brain , and you see a the of the and colleagues in harvard .
the left is the of a person who sees looking at a picture .
the middle of the is a same person same person who just to see the image .
and the right - ended up through the of the left of the left , shows that the difference is zero .
this was been in many different people , with many different , always a similar outcome .
there 's no good way between the actual the of the image and the picture of the picture .
let me show you next experiment , jack 's the on the the berkeley .
in this experiment , the individuals hundreds of hours of youtube videos were making by their brains , and created a created the that created the reactions that the reactions the of the .
and then a new movie shown with new images , new , new .
the computer , just the , the , the new and the and what he thought he was actually the person .
on the right side , you see the see the of the computer and the on the left side the .
that 's where the language is .
we are so close .
we need to improve the .
and forget , you see , if you see a picture , and if you imagine , the picture of seeing the same thing , almost exactly the same .
so this was with the highest resolution of the today 's the , and the resolution has been improved in the last few years .
next , we need to do better even more to improve more to get into .
how do we do that ?
there are many different ways for this approach .
a way would be to break the skull and .
this is nothing for me .
it will going to many new the , even , but given the of the of the , we have to ask ourselves whether we have this end of this technology .
conventional experience can experience can only can only be human to become more , but at the point of the , not just as much as we need .
i 'm suggesting this : instead of , instead of , we need to get better .
we can make a lot of structures using easily , slightly little , like a little bit like a .
so , why is this important ?
in the last years , in the , really legal .
but most of the most progress in the resolution was actually built by the , and in the in and the in the .
so we need to - the - pattern , instead of a of the , to add the to add the .
so we can , thanks to this combination of this dynamic pattern with the the - information from a single .
when we use the use of we should be able , not just the flow of blood , but also from of and , as already , and perhaps even to measure the the of what the goal is .
we 're going to be able to our ideas directly on the digital media .
can you imagine language and directly with human ?
what would we be able ?
and how are we learn learning with the truths of human ?
they think the internet is big .
these are these big questions .
it may be more powerful than the instrument that our thinking and our .
and this instrument could be able to cure by alzheimer and diseases .
we have no choice to open as open door .
it 's hard to make it 's longer .
we need to learn to make this step together .
thank you .
i think we all .
her can be able to tell someone to the first time you 're asking them , or someone to be pregnant , or someone to say they 're cancer , or one of the other people we in our lives .
the after the , is always , difficult , and even though the topics are very different , the experience is to have a secret to and to .
it 's scary , and we hate it . it 's got to be done .
years ago , i was working in the cafe the south of a inner town in the town , and i was walking by the the : no the of the the , the of the as a .
and depending on , " the " my the , and just as my hair had just been me , often , often question me , " a little child , " , " do you like a girl or a girl ? "
and then they , the a silence .
i was my teeth a little bit of , my with my little more .
the father 's his newspaper , and the mother her father to her a .
but i did n't know and i was .
so i promised myself to say , i would say to say , next time .
i would going to make this conversation .
so after a couple weeks , it was back .
" are you a boy or a girl ? " girl ? "
i 've got my quotes the quotes .
i actually got a little excerpt out of " the the .
so i deep , and look at , and a girl in a pink dress , a , not a , a child with a question , " are you a boy or a girl ? " girl ?
so i going to , i 'm going to , and i say , " hey , i know , it 's something .
my hair are like a young , and i 'm wearing the , but i 'm a girl , and you like to a pink , and you rather than your instead of ?
so , i 'm more of the the . "
and this kid looks to look at the eyes , without , and says , " my favorite is purple with fish .
can i have a the ? "
how about it a ? "
this was the most difficult conversation i ever .
and why ? because that 's the , and i was to be .
how many of us had some secrets in my life , and yes , mostly it 's that i 'm .
but you do n't see people who are carrying with .
you just know how it feels like a secret .
so my secret is not from your or your . or your .
i 'm sure you can give you a reasons why my harder was than her , but it 's about : it 's not hard to do .
hard is hard .
who says that it 's harder to explain someone to you have to the than someone to you to say ?
who says that his 's a harder when your child - child is they 're going to be ?
there 's no harder , there 's only hard .
we need to stop that our own trouble with other people with others , only us to better our or better or better , we should have compassion because we have all have it .
at some point in our lives , we all have all of and give us security , or at least more of , than what happen if we could them .
but i 'm here to tell you that , regardless of what you 're is , you do n't want to wear it .
i wearing a the , a the dress , and a the .
i was n't the most the - old who was ready to fight with everybody who to the cafe .
i was scared of fear , my the in the corner , with my dark and my , and a move , and the muscle thing that i had ever done .
my family , my friends , my strangers -- i had spent my whole life to try to try these people , and i the world the head .
i the of the the that we 'd been for long , but if they do n't get this the , they will kill them .
one of my favorite was at the sister of my sister .
and after a little bit , a woman , " i love ! "
and it started to the battle of the .
" the , you ever in the ? "
" well , we actually have friends in san francisco . "
we never been there , but we heard that it 's supposed to be . "
" the , you my - ?
he 's really good , and he has never a . "
" the , what are you do you most ?
our favorite ? our : our want to want and
and you know who we love ? jack .
jack is our favorite . "
and then a woman , but , me to show me their support , and to me that she was on my side , i finally it out of her , " so my husband is wearing a . "
i could to my friend and my and about the responses , their and their , the political the of the political , and i could be able to , and that perhaps one of the most things that was , and
sure , it would have been able to show the finger to your fingers .
it 's more harder to you where you 're just going and the fact that you have , .
and what can you choose to someone else , except it ?
when you start to somebody to somebody , you must be willing to get back to .
heavy conversations are still not my strength .
ask you , i ever .
but i will going better , and i like to like to call it , the three .
and you look at this , but with knowing that 's always difficult to .
number one : be them .
take the . you .
no child in the cafe in the cafe , but i was the .
if you want somebody to somebody , you know , he has to know that they suffer .
number two : you 're right . just it . you pull the off the .
if you know that they 're , they just say it .
if you say your parents , they 're willing to be , will hope that hope that this is going to be .
give them not give you a of a false .
you 're going to your own .
excuse never .
and in this way , some people may be , surely , they thought they what they did , but they never what they are .
and yes , some might be disappointed , but that 's not the problem , not your .
those are their expectations of who they are , not their .
that 's their story , not their .
the only story that counts is that they write .
so , if you look at the next of your secret , and you feel the the , remember , remember that we know it 's .
they feel very , they 're not .
we know it 's hard , but you have to open , no matter what your secret is , there are many other , to the next to the door , and you , and you , and you know the world that we 're stronger
intelligence -- what is that ?
if we were to be like intelligence , the famous quote from the , " the question , whether a machine can be , is like interesting as if a can do a . "
as a the wrote , he wanted to write the early press of the , like , .
but if we think about it , what the most interesting thing we have to most of our cities , building machines and building , building , we see that we can only understanding the physical of the and building that machines
so i tried to try a few years ago , the physical of the intelligence .
let 's take a step back .
and start with a start .
imagine if we were n't know that there 's nothing about biology or intelligence , but have a that we can see the earth , and a long life that we have to change the earth , even billions of years .
there 's a very effect , a very effect .
because that the earth is spread to the , of from the , and to point , and that 's about the , 2000 , the earth on earth , otherwise would be , or more , or , before they get the earth .
we know , as a , of course , we the reason we 're trying to save ourselves .
we 're trying to avoid a .
but if you 'd a , of nothing of knowing nothing that has no idea of intelligence , you have to see a theory , why that have to a certain time in the surface of the planet , the do n't do more .
i 'm saying that the same question is the question of the nature of intelligence .
so i 've been trying to do that in a few years ago , many different topics of different areas , which i think , all one , the intelligence of the .
so with the knowledge from all these different , i 've asked me , asked me , whether there 's a intelligence framework , we can we can from all these of these ?
is there a single equation for intelligence ?
and the answer , i think yes , " t the " which is right now , probably the best - to for the i 've seen .
what you see here is a statement of the that intelligence is a force that so that the future is the .
it does so that the future is the , or , with strength with the very of the , to a future .
in short , intelligence , i do n't like to make a trap .
intelligence is trying to future and open .
now , with this equation , it 's what natural question , what can we do with this ?
what can you make it predictions ?
do you human intelligence ?
do you artificial intelligence ?
now , 'm going to show you a video that i think , i think some of the most applications is this .
but what if this connection between entropy and intelligence on a ?
what if intelligent does n't only work with the production entropy , but it even actually come from ?
to order to figure out , we have a , a " , " , to the production of entropy to every single of the to the .
and has many , many , games , played , even money , to , without any time .
here are some examples of the the in action .
as a , without the , we can see here , a on a car .
now this behavior remarkable , because we 've never have a goal .
she just to the .
this ability to play , it will be for robotics and technical .
so as some animals in objects in their environment , using in spaces , a small , a small tool into a space that has a third , and third , third of the .
this ability will find to find more popular and agriculture .
also , as some animals , animals by at the end of a end of a to food , we 're seeing that there 's a , that 's it , in model .
this has interesting for many of and many other .
the can be applied to a variety of areas .
and here we can see successful against the itself , itself , what you 're in play .
here we see here is how we see new connections of social networks , social networks , wherever friends always lose the , they lose the to successfully the .
the same capacity of has also in the energy , energy and intelligence .
here we see seeing a , which is how a massive , the , and , to , their in the pacific .
and the same , the same is the - based on problems in central - scale , and transportation .
and finally , we see here , like a cheap , expensive - the at a massive - called the and the of the .
and this ability to the capacity is being used in and .
alex the : we just saw that a of a cognitive , like , and cooperation , all of the single equation that makes a system to make its future .
this leads to a deep irony .
when we go back to the beginning of the first , the game , then it 's the concept that we had intelligence , it 's a of a .
the machines would turn us to us .
so a important from that work is that we have been seen the concept of the concept that we 've seen the concept .
machines are n't going to come and try to try the world .
another important thing is the the .
i often ask , how do the ability to accept goals , from this ?
to the , richard , physicists physicist , once that the human civilization would be to be the to the , that all of us are made up tiny , when you 're far away from , but when they 're close together .
my of this statement to learn a little bit to the intelligence of intelligence , or help them understand human intelligence , intelligence is should be seen as a process of a to a future process , and future , and future .
thank you .
