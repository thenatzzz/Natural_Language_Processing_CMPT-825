when i was in my 20s , i had my first the .
i was a and i was particularly in berkeley . berkeley .
she was a woman named alex .
when the came up the first , she came up and she a , and she fell into the couch in my office , the her and told me , about .
and when i heard this , i was .
my , had a patient for a first patient .
and i got a woman in the people who wanted to talk about .
i 'll leave that , i thought , .
but i did n't have it .
with the stories , that alex opened into the , was easy to me just to with head , while we were the problems .
" 30 is the new 20 " , " alex , and as far as i did , i had right .
work came later , later came later , later came later came later .
people in the , and alex , and i did n't have time .
but soon my was , my head , to ask .
i was going to .
i said , " yeah , you know , you 're with your with your , you with a , but she 's not going to marry . "
and there said my , " , " not yet , but maybe you 'll save the next .
and also , the best time on the to work before they married . "
this is what psychologists call a call .
that was the moment that occurred that i did n't know the new 20 .
yes , people later to look at times as a , but did n't mean to do the the .
and so , the alex , the , the , and we got there and we sat them .
and i realized that this kind of the a problem with real consequences , just for alex and their the , but for the , and , and all the people in the .
at that moment , there in the united states , 50 million people in the .
we talk about 15 percent of the population , or 100 percent , if you get to get the without the without going to go through the .
if you guys , if you are in your .
i want to show you some of .
oh , yeah ! you 're all incredible .
if you work with somebody , the , loves , because of the , in the , i 'm going to see you -- . people in the really are really important .
my , my are in people in the , because i think that every single million should know what psychologists , and , the of the , and most things that you can do for the work for the , for happiness , perhaps
this is not my opinion . that 's facts .
we know that 80 percent of the the moments are to 35 .
that means that eight of 10 decisions , experiences and experiences that make out of your life , make it , until you 're going to be ,
do n't you if you 're talking about 40 .
this group is going to be fine , i think .
we know that the first 10 years of a , and how much money .
we know that more than half of americans are married or with the future partner or partner .
we know that brain is going to be the second and big grow in the and for the , which means whatever you want to do , you now time to be doing that .
we know that the are during the , when the , in the , and the women the of the and the and the and they to 35 things .
so in the , you were the across the body and the possibilities .
when we think about the development of a child , we know all know that the first five years for years and are in brain .
it 's the time the , life a impact on the future .
but we hear about little bit about there are something like , and our are a time .
but the people get n't heard in the .
the press talking about the the of the .
scientists call the of a .
journalists are the of the people in people in the like " or " . "
that 's true .
so , as culture , we have the what the decade is the decade .
the that things are a with a plan and a little bit little time .
is n't that ?
so what happens when you put someone in the head , and say , " you , you get 10 years to make a little bit of your life ?
nothing .
this person is the the and the and the and it 's not nothing .
and so every day , people in the or your and say something like , " i know , my do n't know , but this relationship is not . i 'm just saying that time . "
or you say , " all , as long as i 've done it for 30 years , it 's all . "
but later , it sounds like , " my are almost , and i did n't have any .
i had a better fortune when i had finished college . "
and then it sounds like this , in my , my , like the .
all the and had fun , but then , 30 , the music came out of and everybody began to .
i did n't want to be the only ones that i stayed , i sometimes i , i my husband , because he was in my in the . chair . "
where are the people in the in here ?
does n't do that .
ok , that 's easy to say , but not does n't make any sense , because it 's about much .
if a lot of things that the into the , there 's a enormous pressure to go through a , a city , a city , a partner and two or three or three or three or a lot of time .
and many of these things are more the and like the , are just showing the the and so all the time in the .
the does n't mean to buy a red .
it means that you want to make the career you want to do .
you ca n't have this kid , you ca n't want to be able or ca n't want to be able .
too many people in the and look at themselves and myself and say , " their say , " what did i have ? what did i just thought ? "
i want to change what people in the and doing .
this is a story that shows how it can .
it 's the story of .
in my , when she was 25 , she had it had a .
she said she 'd like to work in the art , or the , but she had n't decided to have , had been in the last the last years .
because the was , she lived with her friend , who more than his .
and even though their were , were their worse were still worse .
they often in the , but then she would be up and said , " your family could you , you , your friends . "
one day , came very , and almost all the hour .
she had bought a and she and she spent the morning , her , but then you look at the that the " , " in the " in the "
she was almost the when she came to me and said , " who 's going to be me if i have a accident ?
who 's going to me if i have cancer ? "
in the moment , i had to say , " i "
but the no music , really to look at them .
a needed a better life , and i knew , was chance .
i had a lot of my first time to just how the in the .
and in the next weeks and months , i 've been three to anyone who anyone , whether , or , or should .
one of all , i told , she had n't have any , they would be a .
and i , to you to something that would be to .
power to make something that you think about is investment , invest in something you might be .
i knew about the , no one knows how the future of work , but i do n't know , the .
so now , time is this job , international this job , this , which is trying to try .
i do n't have the of the of the but the , that the n't count , the way , the way .
this is the .
i said to , the , but the , but .
second , i said , the urban is .
good friends are , to get to the airport , but , the people with people who are like to think about how they 're what they what they think they how to they to and how they work .
this new this new person to the of the outside of outside of the own .
new things are made of " the " , so friends
it 's true : the half of the is not or not .
but the other half is not , and they have the .
half of jobs never have . if you 're your boss to your neighbors , your , your job , not a job .
this is not a . so 's how information .
the last advice : what believed you could n't choose the family , but the friends .
this was for her as her , but as soon as soon as soon as soon as you were to your own family , if you 're a partner and a family .
i told her , time , a new family , would be .
you might think maybe that 's better than you 're talking to 20 or 25 , and i agree to you .
but the you 're you or you live in your life , if everybody 's facebook on facebook , is not an progress .
the best time to get your marriage before , before you have a , and that means that the in the love in love in love in your .
your family , means , consciously and the , what you do , and not , because it works , or anybody with the time that you 're just right .
so what happened to do ?
we walked her and found them the secret of a the who was in a different state in a museum .
this weak band to her , get a work .
and this gave her friend her .
now , five years later , it 's the for museums .
she has a man who she her .
she loves her new and her family , and she told me a card , which was " now the line is " in the , you do n't get enough "
sounds the sounds like this , it 's all easy , but that 's what i love about .
it 's so easy to help them .
in the , like the planes airplanes , the just left the and somewhere to west .
and after the , can make a little difference make the difference whether you 're in or in .
the equally for , or , a conversation , a beautiful , a completely a can have a tremendous impact over years and even across generations .
this is an idea that all the to that should knows .
it 's so simple to what i to .
i 've the privilege to do this as a every day : the are not the new , so you on , you a , you use your own your own family .
do n't tell you what you n't , or not .
your is now .
thank you very much .
in the entire industry , it was always our goal to connect the between and information , the gap between our physical world and the world on the screen where we can our imagination .
and this distance is smaller , smaller and smaller , and now it 's smaller than a millimeter that 's a , and computers and for are become for every .
but i wondered , how would it be no limit .
i looked like what would look like .
first i 've this tool that i into the digital world , so if you put on the screen , it 's the physical .
designers can put their ideas directly into 3d and surgeons and to the at the screen .
so this tool , the tool was so the .
but our hands still remain outside the .
how can we do with the with the digital information with the digital information and the of our hands ?
in microsoft , i 've done with my mentor , the , computer and a little room in the keyboard in a keyboard .
so that a apple screen and screen and the of the fingers and fingers face , and you can put his hands on the keyboard , the and the with the hands .
and windows and put a position in the room , you can just pick it as easy to you a book from a shelf .
then you can through this book and you and , and all this , the of the the .
architects can their hands both their hands and .
so in these two examples , we 're going to digital .
but how would we take that all the time and the digital information that we us ?
i 've sure many of you have already to articles online later .
but now you have to worry about it .
here i have a " the . "
this is the view of you , you a of your head or a your car , or the your system the geometry of the body .
this idea , i started thinking about it , the idea of the just not just in the space , but it 's but it can make them and feel .
how would a look like a future ?
in mit media lab , i 've with my the and my collaborators , and i 've been a .
now , in this case , this is like a tiny - in our world , which means that computers , and people can see this object everywhere , at least small little of these .
effectively , we have the gravity and control the by magnetic , and these .
by adding the object , we it from the through the and time , and it 's possible to move movements and in the real world .
so example can be over - visual - , or the , or , and again in the real world .
students can use this to use complex concepts of learning and physics and , and a , or a , or a is a and experience that experience and it 's very powerful .
and more than that , just as we have now in the computer , it 's to imagine how the of the world is actually transform our daily activity .
as you can , digital will not only not only us to show us with our interact with our as our part physical , ourselves of ourselves .
today , we 've started starting by talking about borders , but if we remove the limit , the only frontier is our imagination .
thank you very much .
i was been to for two years to become a the , in china , china , in the 1970s .
when i was in the first grade , i wanted to get government to school for school , all the paid .
but my mother said , " no . "
my parents wanted to me to engineer .
after they the , they believed they were that the only way to happiness , and safer , good job .
it 's not important if i do n't have the job or .
but my dream was to be a chinese .
i 'm that i on my .
a has to do with a very early way , so i tried to try to go to the .
i wrote even the and the to the of a .
but the adult does n't give my idea .
the adults did n't believe it was me to me .
only my friends had me , but they were also just as much , as i am myself .
and with 15 years i knew i was to old to with the training .
so my dream would never be true .
i was afraid of fear that i could only could to the rest of my life .
but that 's so that 's .
so i had to look at the head , and i could find another .
no one there to me , me well , too well .
so i to .
i the my hunger to the , with a book and a " the the of " i was my in the , the the tradition , " in " the " been inspired
[ " the " ] " from the , i came to the united states , and what did i read first ?
of course , books that are in banned .
" the good earth " from life of the chinese .
it 's just not just as propaganda . i understood .
the bible is interesting , but odd .
but that 's a subject for another .
but the fifth commandment taught me a of , " you know your father and your . "
" honor " i thought , " that 's so much and much better than " . "
that was my way to and to and to the and relationship to my parents .
through with a new culture , i started reading the reading .
this was a whole .
for example , i did n't really have a very interesting first , because chinese students are with this .
it never occurred to me that china does n't have to be in the center of the world .
so a map tells something about the personal .
the , the reading is not new .
in the academic world , it 's a the .
there 's even the like the and the .
comparison and a understanding of a .
so i thought , if you read reading in the research , why does n't live in everyday daily ?
so i began to read two books at the same time .
you can act of people -- [ " franklin " by the , " john " david by david , who was the same , or friends with their experiences .
[ " we " we know , " -- " life is a of , and , and the stories of the , in the , joseph , joseph " joseph " ] and , had to had to .
in were in the , the , the political and political nature .
they were all they were all nature , and social -- interesting .
if you make a , it fun to read the the to read two languages .
[ " the " for a " the " the of the water -- the the of " instead of me in translation , i figured how much i can .
i 'm , by , i think , " happiness " happiness " joy "
" in " in means " new mother " . "
books for me , a , through , and i 've got a connection to the people and the present .
i know that i never feel , or i 'm feeling .
a dream is really nothing compared to what many other .
i came to come to that it 's not the only purpose of a true . true .
his purpose is to us to get to where dreams , where our passion and our happiness .
even a dream can this purpose .
because of , i 'm here today , happy , happy with a with a purpose in life and with a lot of time .
you books always be with you .
thank you very much .
thank you very much .
thank you very much .
when i was eight years old , a new girl was in the class , and she was so amazing , as girls as girls .
she had a hair and a little the , was in and .
i was in , i until i had a plan .
so i stayed a little bit longer , school , and i was in the .
when the air was , i came into , i went into the classroom , i took the the of the .
and then i did .
i the the notes of my the , just some few .
all the the .
when i wanted to make the book , i noticed that some of my other had to be pretty good .
so i in the all of the , no .
i gave all of all , and i myself , because i was because i was also all the time .
i 'm still more about my behavior .
i do n't understand where the thought came .
i do n't understand why i did so good .
i felt really good .
i do n't even know why i never been to .
it was so obvious .
i was never caught .
but most of me , why it so that little girl was in the ?
i 'm not happy .
it 's so , .
we know that babies are under suffering .
similarly , primates . the are inherently from nature .
we know that the of the is among in the united states .
but i never a study that i could their or their or their .
so , to , to , to the literature , because novel is the lab that the in the in the all possible forms .
is it a to say that if we did n't have any , we did n't have no literature ?
so no do n't have a the , " no " . "
no the king , not " the " . "
no shakespeare .
because , as the the of the , we , " and " and " the " the " the . "
no , no , no , . i know that it 's in to say that the has the answer everything has , but in the , he has really it .
this year , we this , the , the the of " the " for " for the time , and his analysis the to the and the , and my thing that we have hope .
think , think , think , right ?
we think of the little boy that 's trying to sleep .
we think thinking about a piece of cake , in the .
we forget how the his vision was .
we forget how the it is .
these are books are the the of the like the .
i do n't know how the is , but we say , he 's .
let 's look at the why the novel and the that the and so well .
is it so obvious that drive is -- , such a basis for a story ?
i do n't know . i think it 's just hard to the , because think what happens when we 're .
when we 're at the , we tell ourselves a story .
tell us stories about the lives of the other people and make it that it 's us bad because they 're so bad that it 's us .
as a , of the history , and the audience we know what the detail has to the into the .
the way to make us all to us , and , and , and , and .
in the first band , " in the world , one of the great , about his and , so , as they as they and , " wait , " i love woman , someone else
everything you give me and me joy , might be happy to joy , even in this moment . "
this is the story that he tells telling , and from there to the to the that he 's a new , he 's in the his of his , his in his private the .
we 've got to admit that the and the are the .
and friends have to leave the country if they want to with him to him .
but you do n't need to be to , to realize that it 's hard . right ?
there 's a .
it 's a feeling that 's to be .
what do the ?
it 's like information .
i want to .
the , the the of brown hair and little .
i want to get photos .
so 's why it 's so successful .
basically , the language of science and science and the .
when these the , suddenly the door , the of the , and he the his , he this behavior .
he says , " you think you 'll be that 's a , but it 's not nothing to a text , or a text , or a . "
he says , " there 's scientific worth value . "
and what 's trying to show us is that the is and makes us look at the core of her , and for the truth , the truth , and the truth , the , the better , the better .
in , that 's for the way to wisdom .
he says , " a woman that we need to suffer us , us a greater and more complex more feelings than the genius of a man who 's interested . "
he tells us about that we should make women ?
no . i think he 's us to say that he tells us to tell us about ourselves .
is there another different sense that we us in this particular way ?
even though we feel our hidden and our and ?
and we , we do n't feel different with different kinds of sound ?
freud , later , write .
one day was a by a very young man who was who was the by the thought of his wife , his wife .
and freud says , this man is kind of strange , because he does n't even know what his wife does .
because she 's innocent , and everybody knows that .
the poor creature is lower under the .
instead , he looking for his , without it , so , behavior .
she too , she to with a man ?
[ freud ] says that the man is the of the of his wife .
the novel is very good at this point .
the novel describes very well , how much hard us , but not .
because the more we are , the more we us to .
so i think that way that we do n't get to do to do things or illegal .
i 'm to be very .
and i think about eight years , but i think also the story i 've heard in the news .
a woman from michigan was written , she because she was designed by a self - the , the news for himself .
a whole year .
they tried to get the new friend of her shoes into the shoes and i to when i heard the , i was with .
because ... let 's be honest .
what does it mean , if creativity , creativity , right ?
this is something a novel .
this is something from a novel the .
the is one of my favorite .
she 's the most the and most woman american .
from her , " two in the train , and the the mr. , " books how to -- to keep your mind , and we 're in the realm of the that the in between the in the and what might be
take a the , your character .
first , all , tom , they have got to have , and they have , and he and what they had once , and they like , and it 's , by the , and he name on their name , he 's their .
this is a way .
but what do we do ? we ca n't make it as tom .
i ca n't give the world anywhere , even though i 'd like to make it on some days .
it 's a shame , because we live in a time .
we live in a " - time era . time .
we are all good social media that are currency , right ?
does the novel of the ? i 'm not sure .
but we do what do when you 're not safe if you 're in a .
let 's go back to the street and ask questions to the .
think of think about think about think about the , as a professor , this great .
but i liked to the , the boss of the with the face of a rat , the the needs , needs , the the genius , it 's him to .
that 's me familiar .
so , needs his help , help him and the and the stories of stories .
but when you start to start starting to start something , and eventually in the " six , " and , and all of his solution , is the to and say , " we 're not the on them , mr. the .
we are proud . them . "
and he 's that there 's no to the , the would not n't shake the shake .
that 's one of the few times that we can see the in the stories , and i think this little very smart , but also 's a .
it seems like that 's not an emotional , but a problem .
in a moment , it 's a moment on a different of like .
and in the next moment , they 're on an wavelength .
suddenly , it 's to this , he has him .
is it really easy ?
what if a really a problem ? if it just about how we deal with the other relationship ? "
maybe we would n't be to be the on the .
we could make us .
but i like the .
while we 're waiting for , we still the literature as a .
literature alone , the .
literature alone , she can the , .
and who 's all the : the good news , the tom , the crazy the , the , the .
we are in society .
thank you very much .
i was about 10 years old and on a the - old with my father in my father , a the in the northern of the new york .
it was a great day .
the forest .
the sun would look at the petals like the glass like glass , and if you have no path , you would have almost that we were going to be the first people who are going through this forest .
we came to our .
i saw the little hut on a cliff and across a the , beautiful , as something called something .
behind the roof , a one , four square , with the , the , the and a old the .
i was amazed , i was angry and confused .
the were lazy to the , what they had -- who were , would they would to ?
the question was asked me , and i asked them to them :
who are we going to
how do you also or where " might be , who are behind us behind us in istanbul ?
who are a behind us behind rio in or in paris ?
here in new york new york , the the of every day of day was tons and tons .
i wanted to them -- as individuals .
i wanted to understand who make the job .
how is it be wearing a uniform and wearing ?
so i started a with a .
i drove the , the and went to and in the city , and i was a lot of , but i was still a .
i have to go deeper .
so i took a job as a .
i did not just working with the truck . i was the .
and i was the mechanical the and the snow .
it was a remarkable privilege and a experience .
everybody asks after the .
he 's there , but not as the as you think , and days , it 's really bad , you 're pretty quickly .
and you to the weight , you just hard .
i know people who were this year , and , and their body still weight their body , to tons of every .
and then there 's the danger .
after statistics of the the , the in the under the among the country in the country . and why i learned why .
you 're all the entire day in traffic , all over the .
everybody wants to and often do n't have to be .
that 's really bad for the workers .
and the garbage itself is full of the that the from the the and terrible .
i learned also about the of the .
if you look from the the , and from the back of the city of a city , you can see that the is a .
he does n't stop to .
it 's also like a kind of a or a .
he has to be in movement .
and then there 's the stigma .
you put the uniform and , somebody -- whatever -- whatever -- you get your traffic or your or you 're going to close to your apartment , or you can your coffee your and you and say you
i think this particular because i believe in the of the most important city on the streets of the city . that 's three reasons .
they 're the of the health .
if you do n't waste the waste , every day and efficient and it would take the of the and the and the would give us on very .
diseases that we 've been achieved for decades and , and would spread and us .
the economy takes it .
if we ca n't do the old stuff , we do n't have a place for the new , and the motors of the to start to the , the is the is the .
i do n't not know the capitalism , i just the .
and then that 's what i call our , .
and i mean , just as fast , we 're now , movement .
we do n't care about ourselves , our , our or our , or , or .
we take them , throw them away , forget , because we know that people on people on the other side , are taking care about .
so , i want to today some ways of how we think about how to think about how to improve the and them into those entertainment how you create a city that are sustainable and .
your work , i think , is kind of the .
you see the streets every day , regularly .
they carry in many cities .
you know when you can expect it .
and your work does our .
they 're like a .
the that you 're , us to imagine ourselves before our , the , and we have to be more to every price .
on days after 9/11 , 2001 , i took the of a the on the street , and my son and son and the and there was a man who drove his , he was doing it .
and i tried to him for him work -- all day days , but i started to cry .
and he looked at me and just looked and said , " everything 's fine . "
" everything is fine . "
it was n't until later started i started my research and the the .
his name is the , and we worked together , and we finally got good friends .
i wanted to believe that the had right .
everything is fine .
but in our efforts , change the way we on this planet as a planet , we need to look at the cost of the cost , including the very cost of the work .
and we have to be informed to help people who do this work , how we think about how to create systems about , which is a of the last 40 years and the world , and to us to a species of waste species that are can be
the , we think when we talk about , three percent of the national .
it 's a remarkable statistic .
in your daily , in your lifetime , if you see next to see somebody next whose job is to make them behind , they take a moment time you 're .
take a moment to get to .
hello , hi , what goes ?
that 's not enough .
hello , hi , what goes ?
my name is the , and i 'm not drunk , but the doctor in my birth .
he 's six my six and my little , and the air .
so that 's why i have the , which means that i the time .
look at that .
it 's a . i 'm a of , and .
now , is genetically .
it 's not a the . you ca n't get it .
nobody one has the of my mother , and i did n't get it because my parents are so much what they are .
you get through accidents , like the day my birth .
i have to warn you . i 'm not a source of inspiration , and i do n't want anybody to me to me because you all have seen in a point in your life .
and just 's just coming to .
it 's just a christmas in the . and you see the beautiful circles of looking at a and what you see ?
the .
and you think , " why ca n't i be a little bit ? "
i have to say you , i 'm 99 problems , and it 's only one of them .
if there was a of the , i a .

the the often that my dad wanted to me , so i used to milk of the , and into the dead sea , and i know how the water in the eyes and i thought , " it worked ! it worked ! "
but we found a , : .
i have to say it 's really boring , but before i did , i a , a , a not a n't even .
now i can stand on the head .
my parents always me that i would be able to make sure that not was not impossible , and my dream was to be the general . "
because of , i got a great scholarship on the the , the who 's the state , because i 'm every of .
i was kind of the the of the .
all me .
i do n't like all of the homework , so , all of all of my , getting in all of these .
every time i a from the " the , my teacher .
but i never got a role .
in my , the , the , the piece of piece of the " dance , " dance ,
a piece of a girl with .
i was a girl with .
so i everywhere , " finally , i get a role !
i have a !
finally !
thank god , thank you , i 'm free ! "
i did n't have the role .
the brown had got the role .
i was the to the of the , i the , when someone had my cat , and she asked why she said me , she told me that i would n't going to do the .
i said , " sorry , but if i ca n't , if you ca n't , the character ca n't . "
i was born for this role , and she gave them a without a .
college the life .
hollywood is known to physically healthy .
after i graduated , i was my role as a the in a .
my dream was true .
and i knew that i was soon to " the "
but instead , i stayed a the that was just the , and i realized that the did n't have a , .
they just only perfect people .
but , you know , the .
i grew up with the , the and the , and all of these women had a common : they were the .
so i became a .
my first job was to , new york city new york city new york , and i 'm never going the of the first the that i ever stopped , forget him , in new york to new jersey with a with a with a .
i was in the united states , the united states , i 've also been the east in arabic , the and the .
some people say , i 'm the first - in the arab world .
i do n't want to ask the first , but i know that you know , you know , never heard of the bad little bit that women are not , and they find us to .
2003 , my brother from a mother and father , father , the , and i was the new yorker new american the that now have to be the .
our goal was to the negative image of americans from in to change the media and to the , that the and not .
the of the was much than the challenge against the stigma of disability .
my breakthrough was 2010 .
i was been to the in the the " the " the " .
i was like to the the the , and she 'd me into a studio and i sat on a chair .
so i looked at the the looked at and said , " sorry , i get a different chair ? "
and she looked at me and she said , " five , four , three , two ... "
and we were live ! live !
so i had to go on the table of the , so i did n't get out of the screen , the when the was after me , i was .
there was my opportunity , and i had her , and i knew that i never back .
but mr. the did not me , but , but made me a and my chair .
and working with the i 've been working with a i 've learned something like all the internet .
people say , kids are , but as a child or adults , or never been me .
in the world wide web , i am talking about my disability of the .
when i look at online , i see like , " the , why ? "
" the , is the the ? "
and my favorite : " the .
did it have ?
we should be for them . "
even , my disability into the the , : the , the , the .
a disability is such as .
if a ca n't play , ca n't play .
the are the biggest -- yes . that 's a worth value .
people are religious are the largest minority in the world , and we are the the in the .
the doctors said , " i never walk , but i 'm sitting here .
but i would be with social media , i would n't be here .
i hope that we can make a picture of in the media and create .
maybe there 's no way to the internet when the more difficult to be more positive .
or maybe not .
maybe it 's still a village to do a child .
my journey has been me to me a very few places .
i put on the red next to red the and the the .
i was working in a film with a the and with my , with amazing , .
i 'm as a the with the the " the - the - .
i was a the - in the new york city in the national center .
i 've been a the 's " , a , who 's trying to give the to the chance of a chance that my parents my me .
but the one that moment that most -- before -- this -- the , when i first the how the a and how a bee , the has the way and the way that i do n't .
this was the only time that my father ever seen a the of and i and i was going to talk to this presentation .
: god your soul , your dad , dad . my name is the , " if i can , you can . "
there was a time where we 're big .
on the 21st , july , the from the apollo and , and , and the , the of the ocean .
armstrong and the were alone , but her on the of the was the of a the , .
the the was the largest in history of the united states of america .
to the moon , it 's about billion dollars worth of worth , four or four percent of the .
apollo created for 400,000 people and the the collaboration of companies universities .
people died , including the of the apollo .
but until the end of the end , 24 people to the moon .
from the that are its surface , it 's after death , the last year , now the oldest .
why did they go ?
they did n't go back to look at the old and something that all the 24 later -- a new sense of that our home is small and small .
why did they go ? the , they , because president wanted to show the to the his had the better .
but the on words on a university of the university of a .
for the , was just an victory of the across the east during the cold war .
at the time , this was a feeling about the of the technology .
it was a to the moon because it was something great .
the the - a - a - a - long - century series of technological .
from the first half of the 20th century , the and the and the and , and a vaccine against .
the middle in the middle century polio and smallpox eradicated .
technology seemed to something about what 's called a the a " the . "
for most of the human history , we could n't even faster than a horse or a boat with a , but in the year , the apollo was 10 miles per hour per hour .
since 1970 , no human have been on the moon .
no one has ever faster than the of apollo , and the optimism is about the power of technology , and we 've had to technology to clean energy , or to save the world 's hunger , seem to seem to
i remember as a the , i as a
the of the apollo 17 , and my mother me , not too to the very the .
i had a idea that was the last , but i was sure that i was going to be in my life .
the the " something with our ability to deal with big problems with technology , become a .
you hear it everywhere .
we 've it in the last two days . ted .
it 's a that if us had us to and ourselves themselves with , with things like things and social media and social media , or algorithms , the .
it 's nothing wrong with the of these things .
they have our lives and .
but they do n't solve the big problems of humanity .
what happened ?
there 's a explanation silicon where you 've been that in recently , we 've been doing more than in the years , intel , microsoft , apple and apple .
in silicon valley , you are used to be , in particular , the the , the company companies .
silicon valley says that of have gone to lead to the ideas , and , and problems .
but this explanation is not enough .
it explains mainly what does n't silicon with silicon .
even their times small times small , tiny , 10 years ago , a 10 years 10 years .
investors had always been thinking of energy technologies in technologies like energy that are a and development and , never ever been the development of the problems without having to value .
no , the reasons why we ca n't solve a problem , complicated and more .
sometimes we decide not to the big problems .
we could fly to mars , if we want .
nasa , even has a plan .
but to , a political policy would be public , and so it 's never going to happen to
we 're not going to fly to mars because everybody thinks that there are be done on the earth 's stuff that have to be done .
another time we ca n't solve the big problems because our political systems are fail .
today , less than two percent of the earth 's earth , from sources , solar wind , wind and wind , less than two percent , and the reason is very small .
coal and gas are cheaper than solar wind and wind and efficient is cheaper than the .
we all want to alternative that can keep the the , but it 's no .
now it 's so , and all of all the same opinion of what national and international development , to : mainly a lot of economic development in the development and development and a price of carbon .
but in the current political climate , there is no hope that the u.s. of the u.s. or the international the international the these the and .
sometimes are problems that sounds like , not .
it 's been believed that the is going on the .
but 30 years of research have taught us that political impact .
technologies can things like or systems like systems and , and , but it 's going to be a , there are no governments .
eventually , large problems sometimes the solutions because we do n't understand the problem .
president , the was told the war , but you discovered that there were many of the that are of against therapy , and only years , be in the .
difficult problems are difficult .
it 's not true that we ca n't solve the problems with technology .
we can , we have to , to have these four elements , : politicians and politicians must be interested in order to solve a problem , institutions needs to solve it ; it needs to be a problem . and we have to understand it .
the the that led to a metaphor for the ability to be able to solve the big , to these things .
but this is a model which ca n't happen in the future .
it 's not the year .
there 's no the struggle like the cold war , no politicians like john 's , everything and to a power , and no sense of the like the of the solar system .
but in the , it was just end to moon .
he was only three days .
and it 's really that whether it 's really a serious problem .
we are ourselves and the solutions the future will be to be .
god , it does n't be us to challenges .
thank you very much .
i want to you your eyes .
imagine you 're going to your .
look at the door , their color and the material made of it .
now , you a group of the - on their front .
it 's a the - and - and - and - and - and you to your and your .
you to this .
they 're the down , and directly on .
and then they all directly into your .
bicycles , wheels , all the cross and the , and the in the .
now , you have the in your , or what 's on the side of your brain , and , how the in the room .
the light seems to the .
it 's you from a from a the .
one horse .
you can almost like , his blue gets your nose .
you the the the that it in the .
go over to him , over in your living .
here , you your .
her clothes just the , she they " the " the first of the , " , while they 're on your the .
now , i 'm going to look at your kitchen .
the soil was replaced by a yellow the , and it 's made a the , the the , the the , and the the of " from the " , " , " , " hand , hand .
okay . now , open eyes .
i want to tell you about a very competition , year in the new york in new york city .
it 's called " the .
a few years ago , i wanted to know about this as a the as a the and the who the of the .
it was a bunch of new and some few of , and very different and .
they 're looking at hundreds of hundreds of numbers .
the learned that the names of and the of the of
and it whole thing in just a few minutes .
they were the about who the of a of a the - the .
that 's crazy .
these people have skills .
i started to talk to some of them .
this is ed , a guy who was out of england and there 's one of the the .
and i asked him , " ed , when did you notice you have this particular ? "
and ed said , " i 'm not a the .
i just have a average memory .
everybody who 's going to tell you that he or she 's just a .
we 've all , we , techniques , to these incredible techniques , which is the two years ago , the same techniques that used to his to and to the to books .
and i just , " wow , how does it have never heard of it ? "
we stood outside out of the the and , this wonderful , brilliant , and , funny , english says , me to me , " josh , you 're a american journalist .
you know , you ? "
i said , " what ? " ? " ? " ? "
" i 'd like to teach the the of how to get a order of a the - the .
it would be the world prove that everybody can be here . "
i told him , " i 'm not , but i but i would teach you teach .
i mean , you 've got to start somewhere , right ? "
and that was the beginning of a very interesting journey for me .
i 've spent a lot of the next year , i spent not just to my memory , but also it , and to understand it , how it works , why it does n't work and be its potential .
i have a lot of people interesting people .
so here 's the example , for example , for example ,
he 's suffering under the , and probably the worst memory of the world .
his memory is so bad that he 's not going to be his .
although though it was so tragic , he it in the way how our memory our us to who we are .
on the other side of the spectrum , i learned to the side of the spectrum .
the .
he was the most of the the character in the movie " . "
we spent a afternoon to the public in lake city .
and i came back to a whole pile of the memory , which was two years ago , and in and in the in the and later in the .
and i 've got a whole bunch of interesting things .
and especially me , there was a time to the to the , not nearly as much as the as today .
there was a time when people were in their memory , it 's a .
over the last few decades , we 've a series of technologies -- from the to the , to the the , the , the computer , the smartphone -- the it -- it makes us easier to our , human ability to
these technologies have our modern world , but we us at the same time .
they 've us to us and i would argue that they have us to have .
without the need to , seems sometimes , as we as we forget .
one of the last places of the earth , you find still find people who still are passionate , their , and , and that is this unique .
in fact , he 's not unique , there are the like this around the world .
and this has me the , i wanted to know how these guys do this .
a few years ago , a university at university london group of a brought into the lab .
they wanted to know : is the structure or the of their brains differently than the rest of us ?
the answer was : no .
are you smarter we ?
she gave them a the , and the answer was : actually did n't .
there was a interesting and a interesting difference between the brain and a the a brain and a that was compared .
if you put them into a , and your brain , as you grow , faces and pictures of you can see that the regions of regions of the brain than the rest of us .
it seems like they 're using the part of your device using for the and using .
why ? and can we learn from something ?
the to the memory of a kind of a - state , every year , every year , with a new technology to the to the more of more and the rest of the rest .
this is my friend ben the , the .
on the table , front of him , 36 of the the , he himself within an hour with an technology that he invented and as a .
it 's a technology around the of the in order of 140 , the , in a half an hour .
yes . yes .
and even though it 's a of techniques to put things together in these the , but they all created the techniques on the concept that psychologists called the .
this so - the - this particular concept , this is : how follows : if i look at two to the same word , and you say , " you saying that there 's a person called " . "
this is his name .
and i say , " you know , there 's a person who 's a . "
now , when i go back to a now , you back , and say , " you know , i mean , the word i 've ever been before you before some time ago ?
you know what you 've got it ? "
the person who person the person who is called , with to think of probability , the word that person who person the person who person the person .
same word , things the , ; it 's strange .
what 's going on here ?
well , the name of the means .
he 's absolutely all of all the the that in your head .
but the profession of the , we know what we know .
so white the .
so , have a new on their hands .
so smell , when you come home from home .
maybe we may even know a .
and when we hear that word first , we 've got this whole with the word and the it later that later .
the secret of what going on in the front of the , and to be able to look better at the way to the of the into the into a , -- a that no matter in meaning in meaning in a sense way , meaning
one of the techniques can do two 500 years back to the .
she was known as the known .
the story of his story is : there was a poet called the who a the .
he was the for the conversation , because , when you were a really big , you would n't want to be a , but a .
he 's his poem from the front and the room , and the moment the moment came up with the and all the .
not only are all dead , your body are to the to the .
nobody one can tell anyone who was , nobody knows where who is .
the body can not be properly .
it 's an tragedy after the other .
the 's outside , the only way of this -- it 's his eyes and suddenly he 's he that he 's going front of his eye , where .
and so he 's the hand , and it causes it to the .
now , moment , moment , something that we all know that we do n't matter how bad we , of our colleagues , we have a very good and memory .
i would like to ask you to first the first 10 words of the story about the , so you find it hard to find it hard .
but i bet if i ask you to remember , who remember standing in this moment on a horse in your horse , your , then you might have the .
the idea of the is to create a building and a and it with the images of the things -- the dark , the , the , the , the , the , of the as it 's to .
this is a high - based that on over 2,000 over 1,000 years old , about memory .
so how does it work ?
you 're invited to talk to you about ted talk and you keep it out of memory , as it would be done , he would have been the to over two years ago .
you 're just like this : imagine you your .
imagine a secret crazy and crazy story with a wonderful pictures , and remind you that you first to about these crazy talks .
and then you put in your house and you the on the back of mr. .
and that would remind you to start your friend ed .
and if you look at the , you to a , you tell you .
you put into your kitchen , and the fourth thing you to talk about was the strange journey that you for a year . and you 've got friends you to remember you remember you remember you remember .
so , this research , it did n't know -- not word for word , word , but to topic .
the english term " the , " a theme of , comes from the greek word "
these are some of those people when people about and in terms of .
the " first " in first " in your "
i was just this , and i 'm still , and i 'm still
some of the other 's risks .
i wanted to maybe something about this the of the the .
but there was a problem .
the problem that the are the are .
it 's like a group of people who sit sitting there , and write a test .
it 's already exciting if somebody 's the .
i 'm journalist , i need something to do something about it .
i know that the things that i think about the people in the people , but i do n't have access to it .
so if i wanted to tell this story , i had to position .
and so i began to every morning every 20 minutes 20 minutes before i started with my newspaper , i was something about something .
maybe a poem or maybe a poem or a poem .
the name from a old the that i bought on the the .
i had to realize that it was much fun .
i could never imagine .
it 's fun because it 's not about to train memory .
you 're always better and better , these crazy , the , the , and hopefully images to your eye .
i 'm at it .
here 's me with my the .
a couple of the and a the that were up to two little of , because the enemy is the enemy of the .
i went to the same i had a year after i had a year .
and i 'm going to , just as a experiment .
it could be a nice - for my .
the problem was that the experiment did n't like .
i won the , which , which really should n't have .
it was nice to and , and , and , but that was n't what i wanted to do .
that 's just tricks .
tricks the work because they work on some simple ideas the of our .
you do n't have to build a - or - to - to - to - to - to - to - to - to - how to can .
we often talk about people with people , as if it 's a special , but that 's not true .
good are the .
we 're going to better things when we look .
we remember , if we 're getting .
we remember , if we have the possibility of figure out why information and experiences are about us , why they have meaning , and we them into something that we can sense of our sense of our , and we can call the "
the the , these the , they all .
in fact , it 's not real .
they work because they work us to work .
they 're us to be and , in a way that we 're not usually .
but there are not shortcuts .
that 's how things are in memory .
one thing i want to do with you , i was through , the man who did n't look at his the , learned , our lives are the lives of our memories .
how much are we willing to lose our lives , our , instead of telling us to us , how much are we ready to because we are so lazy that we do n't have the and ?
i learned that the memory , in any of us , incredible .
if we want to live a life , we have to be the person who do n't remember .
thank you .
at the age of 27 , i a job in the for a the , and .
public schools in new york i was to for the .
as every teacher i , i and tests and
i was homework .
when the work , i , i grades notes .
in the , the only difference between the best difference between the best and worst .
the 's some of my students were not the .
some of my favorite kids do n't get very well .
that 's me .
what you do in the . in the , in math , is difficult to get : numbers , the , the , of a .
but not impossible these concepts are not . i found that all of my students all students all the students to learn how to do it , hard and hard .
after some years , i came to the conclusion , we had that we had a much better understanding for students and students and learn from a perspective of motivation , from a psychological perspective .
what we do in the best is the . but what if in the and life , much more than the ability and easy and easy to learn ?
so i left the classroom , and a to .
i started kids and adults in all kinds of different situation , and always wondered , who i am , and why ?
my , and i went to the west institute .
we were trying to what would be the would n't .
we went to national and the to the children would .
we studied the that worked in very tough business , and asked them to teachers the of the , and they were able to improve their students their students .
we were partnerships with and , who would their minds .
and who would make the most money .
in all these different ways , the evidence of an individual and is .
it was not social intelligence .
it was n't good , physical , and it was n't .
it was brilliant .
and is and passion and for long term .
it is the .
and is when you 're a , not just a week , a month , but for years , and really hard to work to plan .
you know , life is like a marathon , not the .
i was started in public school in chicago in chicago .
i asked thousands of students the of the , and they and then they would come over a year to see who was made of the .
it showed that kids with kids are even more difficult to the , even if i all the properties things like , results , tests , even as they did they did in school .
so do n't actually mean only in and , but also in school , especially for children .
the issue about this topic is that for me , that we know so much that science does n't know how much as you do .
every day , my parents ask me and teacher , " how do we study kids of children ? "
how did i teach a look at ?
how do i do it for ? "
the answer : i do n't know .
what i know is that you do n't have to be done .
our data show that a lot of people are not going to remain to .
in fact , in our , not necessarily not necessarily not , but it 's also talent with talent .
so far , the best idea that i 've been to the of , is called the the .
this idea was been at stanford university of stanford university and the that the ability to learn to learn not to be able to change their .
dr. the showed that kids when they read about the brain and learn how it 's to the challenges and challenges and challenges , much more likely to do it much more because it 's not a failure condition .
this posture is an great idea for the .
but we need more .
i want to finish my finish , we 're already so far .
that 's the work that 's us .
we need to best our best ideas and .
we have to do whether we succeeded successful , we have to be willing to have to , to have to lessons and from to .
in other words , we need to see kids .
thank you very much .
in the center of my work is the connection of our to and part of the environment , where architecture from the natural , local conditions and traditions .
today , i 'm like example , i 'm a example , projects .
both of projects are in , and in ethiopia and in tunisia .
they also have common that the different perspectives are different part of the brain to become a part of the .
the first example started with a invitation , a the - in the in capital .
this is the kind of building that we us , my team and me , as an example of what we should be shown .
first i thought i wanted to .
so after we 've seen a couple of these buildings -- there 's a lot of the city -- we that they have found three of the .
first , these are the buildings , they 're very large , they 're very large , people ca n't afford to buy things .
second , they need a lot of energy because the surfaces are glass , the heat inside , and then you need lots of lots .
in a city , not should n't happen to , because they have pretty weather that 's been 25 to 20 to 25 .
and thirdly , you have their with and ethiopia .
this is a place in a place called a rich culture and tradition .
and also , i was really the first really of the old the old market with the old market with this the , where people were going to go and , and , day , day ,
it has also this idea of space that uses the uses - activity to create activity .
so i thought , that 's exactly what i really want to design , not a .
but the question was , how we could build a building , building with these principles .
the next challenge came to when we were to this , because it 's in a city town of the city , where most of the buildings you were sitting on the picture , there were n't there .
it 's between two that have across a hundreds of meters .
first , we created a connection between these two streets , and then there all the the of the building .
this is a - a - that creates a that creates a building in the building itself its own shape and its sun and .
and to get this the , we the idea of a with a little with the little that in every , because of the shape of the change , because of the change .
i also think , how do we end up the building ?
i wanted to really find a solution to go on the local .
i started thinking about think about how a concrete out of concrete with the , which the air , and light , but in the form .
and then i this new buttons in the the .
they have the properties of a geometry , and that helped me to the entire .
we 're building this with little , the windows that air and light on the into the buildings .
and that 's going through these little , the bits that light the light from the of the to the building the building .
it was n't just the to with ideas , because they thought , " this is not a not - shaped . that did n't have . "
but then we realized that we this idea of the idea of the , is the idea of a idea of a , because they can actually sell more .
the concept of the was too much , much , not just because of the material compared , compared , but it because we because we had n't have a conditioning .
so we created some the - that we used to project .
the first time was to think about how to make the building , in a city , a city that almost every day .
we created a call the , by on the roof on the roof .
and under this the , we this as a new space with space and , and that this .
these the on the roof , the water to the into the .
hopefully at the next year , because we have the to 5 .
the second example is a the - for 2,000 in and in institutions .
so to do a big project , the biggest project i 've ever been , i had to understand the city of the city , but also the environment , the tradition , the tradition and the culture .
and this analysis i particular on the , which is the 1,000 - old structure that was from a wall , through 12 through , through and by the way .
when i was to the , the first step to the streets of the to create the first 12 of with large size and like the in and other cities with these the .
so , we , we some points in the into the into the concept of this , and they them with straight , and the changed the original pattern .
the final step was to think about the cell , the small cell of the project , as the as , as a part of the .
what would the best in a climate for a apartment ?
this is the , because of the the between the between the between the two the that created and a natural .
so we put a pattern about the that most of the most that are in this direction .
and that 's the result , it 's almost like a combination of a european and the arab city .
there are the blocks with the and in the , these are the these .
it also the local wall that would increase higher density in the upper and a density in the .
it also the concept of the .
the volume has this shape form that has evolved through three different of , and also to very dense light into the ground , there are three different of , like a and a kindergarten and a nearby of a of the that
the roof , my project in this project , the community 's almost the space to the building .
there can all neighbors and make things , like a on the morning , a building to a building .
these two examples have made a common approach of the .
they 're in emerging where you can see the cities literally .
in cities changes the architecture of architecture in the and future of people local communities and as buildings .
and that reason , it 's important to architecture , architecture , but solutions that are the relationship between the community and the environment and the to it and to connect .
thank you very much .
i want to talk about trust , and i want to talk to you about the opinions .
they 're so ubiquitous to they become the .
there is one of my view .
first of all : trust is a in , many .
then we need to trust more confidence .
and a task : we should build the confidence .
i think the claim the goal and the challenge to the wrong ideas .
i want to give you a different story about a claim , a goal and a better approach to the .
first of the claim : why do people say that ?
and if i really talk to my talk , i know , i do n't know the answer .
maybe it has some in some or , or in some other .
i 'm not going to be the .
but i can look at the surveys of the that the are the source of faith , that it 's a .
look at a look at a period of a , a lot of
and will be people who are 20 years ago , mainly journalists and politicians , still .
and the people who was very , very , still very , : , nurses .
we 're other in between the way , the almost in the middle .
but is that a good proof ?
the - -- .
what could you be that ?
so you look at the general people of people when you 're going to be certain questions .
trust politicians ? trust ?
now , if you ask somebody asked , trust , you trust ?
trust it 's ?
trust it 's ?
and then would you would say , " ? "
and that would be a reasonable response .
and if you answer the answer to you , you might say , " i 'm not some of you , but not . "
it 's rational .
in short , we 're in short , we 're trust in different ways .
we do n't think of it that we every or a or a in an inner .
so i could say about that i was given a particular , first grade , the first class , the , class , but i would n't want to go to the .
maybe i know i know that it 's not going to be good car .
i 'm that my friend a on a , but maybe not that she 's a secret .
simple .
so know how we know from our everyday ways , how different can look , but why do we know this knowledge if we 're thinking about trust ?
the situation are doing a very bad thing about the actual , because they ignore the sense of the that you 're in the .
second , we get to .
the goal is to trust more confidence .
honestly , i think that 's the stupid .
i would n't going to be that .
i would try to trust the more confidence , but not n't .
i 'm actually actively on the to not trust .
and those who have to raise their savings to the hands of a certain event , which the way , the , " the the " i , " i think , too much .
" trust , is no the goal in this life .
trust and be and be to be the goal .
and then you say , yes , okay , what 's the most important is not , but .
the people can people from .
and to do that , we need to look at three things .
are you ? are you honest ? are you ?
if we can a person in the topics , and , and , we have a good reason to trust her , it 's be .
but the person 's probably not , probably not .
some of my friends are and , and i would n't want to letter you letter , because they are the .
i have friends that are very their own , but they 're kind of them .
and i 'm very happy about that i did n't have a lot of friends that are and , but are the .
if you have , i did n't even have it .
but after that , we look at it , then , trust .
trust is the response .
the we do n't need to do that , of course , that 's hard .
over the last decades , we 've been trying to design the full - all kinds of treatments and experts and experts and that make us easier to save their .
many of these systems have the effect .
they do n't work like .
a the said once said to me , " the problem is that the would longer be free than the baby to the world . "
everywhere in our public lives , in our institutions , our institutions , our this problem , and this is to and , but to make the opposite .
it 's how people are their tasks by taking them .
i can , can any of .
so 's what 's going to .
the goal is more , and that 's difficult to be if we want to be , and want to want to communicate and other , and if we want to whether people are , or politicians ,
it 's not easy . you have to make it . simple reactions or not do n't know .
and now to do the task .
this as a as of the describe , the .
because it suggests that they should and trust .
we can do that for ourselves .
we can go a little bit .
so 's two people can improve your confidence .
but ultimately , it 's a by being that by being done by one .
you ca n't do that again what else do .
you have to give you a serious that you trust .
so you have to be .
and of course , of course , is that you do n't usually all of the people at the nose .
but they have to have to have older that they 're .
how does that ?
that happens every day , everywhere . people do , effective .
here 's a simple example .
the store , i made my hate , she me up and ask them ask questions .
they take them back and give me back to me , or some of the in the .
that 's great . i 'll you , because you 've been shown to me .
there 's a morality of morality .
you think of the as , it 's a very good sense that you 're is , you to be your own words .
so our goal is not very difficult to recognize .
it 's relationships between people , and the the , and when the other is different .
so the morality of history is so much more about trust , or about faith , or about the the or the , or , and lot more about and how you people , and evidence of the own .
thank you .
you know , the best thing i 'm most best for me , the films i can look .
i love my own my with my kids , and when my daughter was four years old , we 've together , " the " of " . "
the film has n't left it .
her , of course , was the .
so she had a good excuse to wear a the dress , and a the .
but if you look at this film often , you look at how he 's actually .
we live in the today and our children in a different .
but " the was by .
he did n't have this trend .
it has 40 years to continue this trend , -- interestingly -- a different movie , which a guy from a and a guy with a girl a girl , they just like the of the .
you know , i know what i 'm talking about , right ?
right .
well , there 's a big difference between these two films , even several differences between the of and the movies that we 're looking at today .
first of all , there are in " the of " very violence .
the monkeys are pretty aggressive , as the the .
but i think if the had inspired by the government today , the would said , " the , " the , you 're the of that we were been .
use your shoes to your to by computers , the evil of evil . "
but it does n't happen .
another point i 'm at the " of " is unique , is that the and are even characters .
this is the first time when i was my daughter , star , " i was , was different .
at that time , i had a son .
he was at the time three years old .
he was n't invited to this that he was n't too young .
but he was the second child , and he was less than his sister .
so he 's a , and he 's the film , he 's a his mother , and , and i do n't think he 's going to what he was going on , but he 's it 's in .
and i wondered what he was doing .
did he the it courage , and ?
he the that a army a army to get the government ?
he 's that there 's only in the , and , of course , who is this really cool , but during the time , the with a and a and to him the ,
compare this with " the of " .
how does your the your to a good end ?
by with all the and a .
this is the kind of world i my children my -- , right ? and not in the world , in which are to fight with what 's pretty much of our world today .
why is there so much -- in the movies that are children for our children , and so few so the ?
there 's a lot of good literature about the impact that are about the boys of the boys , and they should read it . it 's very good .
but i did n't read that much about how guys with this .
i know from a experience that the could n't not to the model that i could have to find through the world of adults , and girls and girls and common .
i think there was this moment with the first kiss , when i really expect that the the starts to , because that ends up or right ?
i 've my mission , i the girl .
why do you see there ?
i do n't know what to do .
the movies are very to the and their heart , and there 's not a lot of space for other relationships and other .
it does almost like as a young animal is a animal and when you 're a girl , you better .
there are exceptions , and i 'm going to be the of any of you .
but they give a message to the young to the boys that are not the .
they are real at the girls to how they can to the to the , but they do n't show the boys to the they 're going to against the .
there 's no way for you .
there are also some women who are new stories , and write , and writing and are also , and they 're still the .
and the most common of all the of course , a classic after the other , and every single one of you , a boy , or a man , or two of two men who are friends , and son and son of two men
until many of you , you think of -- this year when they finally the movie " -- " the "
i recommend him all of him . he 's on the internet .
do you remember what the critic said , " the " ?
" oh , " i ca n't believe that has made a . "
it 's very good . let 's not get it that .
but as no one of these movies has the .
i do n't know if you 've heard of it .
it 's not yet not to have that right , and to be , but maybe we 're going to start today .
the is a the and in the middle of the this conversation that she with a girlfriend about the films that had seen .
it 's very simple . there 's only three questions you need to ask : there 's more than a character in the film , which is the and something ?
try to get that .
and talk about women in the time of the ?
and what 's in their entertainment is something else , the guy who they like both like ?
yeah ? thank .
thank you very much .
two women who exist and talk talking about anything .
this is what happens . i saw it , and yet i see it 's the movies that we know and .
in fact , i went to the , to see a very good movie , " the . "
you remember ? a lot of a lot of the , great , a general a sense of what a good - is a good - .
it falls with the through the .
i think that should n't be , because of the time -- i do n't know if you 've seen it -- but a lot of the ordinary in a message where men and women and women during the .
there are some good scenes that men in this deep , of fear , and the great moment , one of the the , is to go through a door and say , " you go to bed , " ? "
this is some of hollywood .
so let 's look at look at the numbers .
in 2011 , under the 100 of , what do you think how many of these were actually in ?
11 . that 's not a .
it 's not so many of the number of women who we just in the congress , so that 's the good .
but there 's a number that bigger than this is and this is this space .
last year , the new york times published the government .
you that you 're saying that you 're saying that
one of five women in the united states that they 've been to live in their lives .
i do n't think that 's the fault of .
i do n't think that have to do anything .
i do n't think that and directly to do something with something , but something 's going on , and when i hear this statistics , one of the things i think that are many of .
who are these guys ? what are they doing ?
what do you do n't learn to learn ?
take your story , that it 's the task of a male , the violence with violence and then the , which is a woman who does n't have friends and not talking about it ?
so let 's take this story ?
you know , as a parent that has privilege , a daughter , just like the same thing that we do , we 're this world and these statistics in and we want to them .
we have tools to how we the , and we hope hoping that help , but i 'm also asking whether 's going to be , when we 're at the same time , active or , our , to their .
the the is a means that we can do something very important , and i 'm talking to the .
i think we need to do our very simple idea of a picture of
the definition of the is already changing .
they 've read how the new york of the roles of the and .
they 're going to mess .
our sons will find a way to adapt to a new relationship , and i think we really have to show you that a is someone who 's his sisters and on your side , and to be really the guys who are men
i think we should be looking for the the to find the , if we find them , and find the search that are there are real human beings to bring people together and to with these and say , " i 'm on
when i was my daughter , who her the in " star wars , " you know what you said ?
the .
the and the and the .
what have these two common together ?
maybe it 's not just the most dress .
i think these two figures are experts .
these are the two characters in the film that know more than everybody else and their knowledge to other people to help them their potential .
and they 're leaders .
i like this kind of job for my daughter , and i like this kind of job for my son .
i want to do more tasks like this .
i want to tasks that my son said , " and go and " and tasks , to join a team , maybe a team that will be to a to help better people better , better people , the of
thank you very much .
i want to talk to you about the story of a the .
i do n't know his name , but his story .
he lives in a small village in south .
his village is near .
the drought of the poverty and the and the the .
and when there was nothing there was him , he left his village , and he walked into the city , in this case , the , the capital .
when he 's there , there no options , no jobs , no way .
at the end , he 's in a outside of the .
it may not a year , but nothing .
one day , he will be a by a man who would him , lunch for dinner , dinner , to the .
he 's this dynamic group of young people and they give him an opportunity .
he gets a little money to buy new clothes and to home and home .
it 's going to be this young woman .
he finally . he .
he starts to new a new life .
his life has a sense .
and a day in the , walk into a walk in the air .
this the with the was the the and group of young people had been the to have a with a with .
how could the story of a the of just trying to in the ?
he had .
he had an opportunity to focus on the future , and a it , the was the first opportunity to him .
it was the first thing to him from a state that we call " the . "
and his story is again over again over the areas of the around the world .
it 's the story of the , in the and london and something different than something . "
young people are moving from the city , their , jobs , work , wealth , but young people do n't have a percentage of wealth .
it 's often the that are under the .
in 2030 , three are five of five in five cities in the cities .
if we do n't young people in the growth of cities , if we do n't have opportunities , they 're going to be the , the in the violence in violence and in the cities .
in my the , 70 percent of the young people are unemployment .
70 percent do n't have work , do n't go to school .
they do n't actually do anything .
last month , i went back after the , and i went to the the , the hospital where i was born .
i remember , i was this hospital , and i asked , what if i would never be here ?
what if i had to the same condition of the " - forced ?
would i have become ?
i 'm not sure what i 'm going to do .
the reason was in this month was the fact , the of a young - for young leaders and entrepreneurs .
i was about 90 young leaders .
we got together and we started a solutions for the largest challenges of their city .
in the room , a young man , the .
he went the university in and his .
there was no jobs and no options .
i remember , he told me that had a the , and frustrated was the perfect goal , member , and to be and other .
they 're people .
but this story takes another different .
in , the biggest obstacles are to from a to b , the streets .
23 years , the have the completely , that the best .
and the , the opportunity and they .
he 's a .
he started to stop the on the that could n't afford to afford .
with his family and family friends , he bought his 10 and he to be able to get his right at the next three years .
how do you tell this story from the other ?
what makes the difference ?
i think it 's his ability to a new opportunity .
it 's the the , and i think that the can be the means to be the means "
it 's the young people in the opportunity to create the that they 're desperately .
you can teach people to be entrepreneurs .
i want to talk to you about a young guy who one of my favorite , : the , a the .
he helped me to give the of some young people who are at the summit , and to show them how to build innovative and .
he 's actually the first the that has been seen since the , 22 years before until before was there , the the was that was that the that ship from the from the from the , when you wanted to the wedding .
when you ask somebody , " when did you last time you last time you ? " the answer was many of the who the of the " never "
so saw an opportunity .
he started a the with a .
he was a outside of and started to the and , and what he said , in the climate .
he started to talk to the flowers , and he was in and , and to the city , and he was working on the of the first public parks in the last .
there 's no public parks in the .
he wants to create a place where families and young people are together and how he said , he said , the beautiful things can enjoy the life .
just 's the , it does n't have a because they too much to water .
so the first step is to young people to inspire , and in this room , the has had a huge impact on the other people in the room .
they never had really thought about it .
they thought to work for a work or for government , but this story , his innovation , had a strong impact on it .
he the them to look at their place as a place of view .
he the them that they can be entrepreneurs to change the change .
at the end of the day , they had innovative solutions for some of the largest challenges of their .
they had the local solutions for local .
the inspiration of young people , and the of a is a really big , but people to their ideas to able to do able to do their ideas .
they need the and to develop her business and develop business .
they 're people with the resources that they need , they give them the support they need to ideas and they will going to create the for growth .
for me , me , more than me more than just a more of a .
it 's about social .
the - sold sell not just flowers .
i think he sold hope .
his design is the , " when it created , the view of people to their city .
the 's the to who to help him to and the .
he gave them the chance to the the state of the " . "
these young businesses have a tremendous impact on their cities .
so my suggestion is , you to young people to get people , and their innovations and they 're more about flowers and " and "
thank you very much .
so during my childhood , my was one of my favorite the to the on the on the of , because my parents are , happiness .
but these are hard to find .
they 're from sand , barely .
but after a certain period , i had a .
i began to see , patterns , who helped me , they .
and it was to find a passion to find things that i love for , and the .
and when i started studying , i realized that see that my eyes n't eyes with my eyes .
because suddenly , in egypt , my beach in a miles , along the the , and my to the of cities .
and that led me to use the .
i had to see differently to see the past in a map .
so i want to show you how we example to we differently , if we use .
this is a gentleman that in eastern called the .
and the the appears , brown , we use but , and , and it 's with , suddenly that 's suddenly a sudden .
what you see here is , the chemical changes of landscape through the and the .
what i want to share with you today is how we used to used to build a city that which the name the name of the and for thousands of years .
the was the capital of the old egypt , as long as a , a , a , a , about years ago .
the , the is in the , and it 's very efficient because it 's in the middle realm of the arts , the architecture and architecture and religion .
and always knew that the of the would be somewhere by the of the , the two , the red , but in the massive .
this area is huge -- it 's the four times three times three .
once the , the , the , directly to over the over , and while , and his moves changed and towards the west , he 's the city .
so how do you find a city in a .
they 're to find to find the equivalent to find the needle in the , with eyes and the .
so we used to the - to - map a map of the landscape to see to see a , changes ,
where the of the used to be used .
but you see , and this is very interesting , this slightly the of , with the circle that we us as a possible position for the city .
so we worked with scientists to the what you see here .
this is like the ice in ice , just instead of the layers , change , climate change , you can , layers , your human .
in a depth of five meters , under a layer of , we found a density layer from the .
this shows that this position for space , in five meters , we can produce more over several hundred years of the , to the to rich , to the to the to the that we existence .
we found the -- the , the , the and the -- and what shows that shows a .
it might not seem to look at much , but if you look at the the stones , which were used by the in the in the , you find exactly the .
so we found a density layer of the the of at this that 's on the rich .
we also found evidence for a for the community society , which shows that this is a very important city .
but there 's no longer , but we 'll going to get to these soon , to a .
what 's important , we to teach for young who are in the school , so they 're so to have to make great discoveries .
so i wanted to be my with my the from the middle of the , it was in the city of the years ago .
" knowledge sharing is the biggest of the .
there 's nothing in this in the . "
ted was n't 1984 .
ideas , actually , in 1984 , in a long , from the .
you can see that the .
thank you very much .
thank you .
i grew up in taiwan as a daughter of a , to my memories , my , the , the , and the form of the chinese .
i was , i was fascinated by this language .
but for a , it seems to as the as the great wall of china .
i 've been wondering how i 've been able to do this wall , so everyone anyone to understand the interest of this complex , this , and understand and .
i thought that was a new way of learning , to be .
since five , the , i learned every single every single every single in every single in the .
in the next 15 years , i 've every new .
because we have just five minutes to have a , and very difficult , very difficult .
a chinese the has about 20,000 .
you need 1,000 for a .
the most 200 are giving them to 40 percent of the simple literature , to understand -- enough to the the the , and the of the time .
today , i start with eight to show you how the method works .
are you ready ?
open your mouth as far as it until it 's .
it 's going to " a mouth . "
this person goes to a .
" human . "
when the the for fire , a " with a person , if he was saying , " help ! i ! -- and the 's is going to the of the , but i like this idea . you take the you
this is a tree .
" tree . "
this is a mountain .
the sun is . "
the moon . "
the the for " the looks like a the from the .
these eight are .
they are the the to create a variety of .
a human .
if someone else is , then it means " follow . "
and then , more , " and " and " a " . "
if a human his poor , " he says , " it was so big . "
the person in the mouth , it 's like .
he 's a " , " as a in the whale .
a tree is a tree , two trees are a for a " . "
three are together for a " forest . "
and they put a under tree and they have a " . "
if you put up a mouth , it means " the . "
just to because a is a is a is a .
do you remember that fire ?
two black people are hot .
three fire together a lot of . "
they put the fire under two trees , it " . "
for us , the sun is the source of the .
two together . "
three are together . "
when the sun and the moon , it means " it 's " . "
in the context , it 's be for the next day .
the sun goes across the horizon .
door . a in the door stands to the . "
so , put a mouth in the door , it says , " ask questions . "
the , the . is there ?
this person the from the door . "
the left is the woman .
two women are two for a " . "
so , in three women , this is called " the . "
we have now 30 of .
and with this method , you can put the in the first eight words .
so the next group of eight are in with other words .
so with a little bit of a few hundred , you can learn how a child - old child .
when we can make these , we start to them .
for example , it makes a and fire , so , "
we know , japan is the land of the sun .
this is the sun with the " because japan because of africa is china .
one is with the is called the " . " japan . "
a human being a ?
a japanese . "
the are the on the left are two mountains .
in chinese , it 's " , chinese , her political chinese in the dark of the mountains .
today , " . "
a mouth says where it 's , " it 's " . "
that 's the slide that reminds me of the stage , thank you very much .
