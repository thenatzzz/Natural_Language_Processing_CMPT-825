----- Both of us wrote chunker.py since it took time to train the model.
----- Both of us read semi-Character Recurrent Neural Network paper and discussed about the methods.
      We explore several approaches such as concatenating the word embedding input to the chunker RNN as an input vector, 
      implementing character-level LSTM encoding, etc.
----- I reviewed and modified the chunker.ipynb.
----- Both of us discussed the structure of our code, model we use in our code, and how to improve the performance together.
